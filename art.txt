spirograph
    Spirograph is a geometric drawing device
    that produces mathematical roulette curves
    of the variety technically known as
    hypotrochoids and epitrochoids

ligne claire
    French for "clear line".
    Pronounced: [liɲ klɛʁ]

    A style of drawing created and pioneered
    by Hergé, the Belgian creator of The
    Adventures of Tintin.
    
    It uses clear strong lines sometimes of
    varied width and no hatching, while
    contrast is downplayed as well.
    
    Cast shadows are often illuminated, and
    the style often features strong colours
    and a combination of cartoonish characters
    against a realistic background.
    
    All these elements together can result in
    giving comics drawn this way a flat
    aspect.
    
    The name was coined by Joost Swarte in
    1977.
