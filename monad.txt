monad
    [#ancient Greek philosophy]

    Almost everything.

    Neither philosophical sense will help you
    understand the role of monads in Haskell.

monad
    [#philosopher Leibniz]

    Almost nothing.

    An irreducible particle of perceptual
    reality.

    Neither philosophical sense will help you
    understand the role of monads in Haskell.

monad
    [#category theory]

    An endofunctor, together with two natural
    transformations required to fulfill
    certain coherence conditions.

endofunctor
    [#category theory]

    A functor mapping a category to itself.

coherence condition
    [#category theory]

    A collection of conditions requiring that
    various compositions of elementary
    morphisms are equal.
    
    Typically the elementary morphisms are
    part of the data of the category.

endofunctor
    A functor from one category back to the
    same category.
    
    It maps objects of the category to objects
    of the same category.
    
    The simplest example is the identity
    functor which maps every object inside a
    category back to itself; more interesting
    examples map objects to other objects in
    the same category.
