personal mythology
    An individual's fundamental stories for
    making sense and meaning of the world.
    
    According to Dr.  David Feinstein and Dr.
    Stanley Krippner, "A personal myth is a
    constellation of beliefs, feelings,
    images, and rules—operating largely
    outside of conscious awareness—that
    interprets sensations, constructs new
    explanations, and directs behavior.
    
    ...Personal myths speak to the broad
    concerns of identity (Who am I?),
    direction (Where am I going?), and purpose
    (Why am I going there?).
    
    For an internal system of images,
    narratives, and emotions to be called a
    personal myth, it must address at least
    one of the core concerns of human
    existence."

Jungian archetypes
    Defined as universal, primal symbols and
    images that derive from the collective
    unconscious, as proposed by Carl Jung.
    
    They are underlying base forms, or the
    archetypes-as-such, from which emerge
    images and motifs such as the mother, the
    child, the trickster, and the flood among
    others
