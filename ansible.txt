Fact
    Facts are simply things that are
    discovered about remote nodes.
    
    While they can be used in playbooks and
    templates just like variables, facts are
    things that are inferred, rather than set.
    
    Facts are automatically discovered by
    Ansible when running plays by executing
    the internal setup module on the remote
    nodes.
    
    You never have to call the setup module
    explicitly, it just runs, but it can be
    disabled to save time if it is not needed
    or you can tell ansible to collect only a
    subset of the full facts via the
    gather_subset: option.
    
    For the convenience of users who are
    switching from other configuration
    management systems, the fact module will
    also pull in facts from the ohai and
    facter tools if they are installed.
    
    These are fact libraries from Chef and
    Puppet, respectively.
    
    (These may also be disabled via
    gather_subset:)

task
role
    It's like a package that you install but
    gives the server a role.

    Either/or:
        ansible-galaxy search elasticsearch
        ansible-galaxy role search elasticsearch --platforms Ubuntu

    Then install it:
        ansible-galaxy install 0x0i.elasticsearch

    [IT automation tool]

    The simplest way to automate your IT
    infrastructure.
    
    Ansible is an automation solution that
    acts as a resource provisioner,
    configuration management tool, application
    release automation, and can provision and
    manage entire application and
    infrastructure environments.

    Can configure systems, deploy software,
    and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks
    such as continuous deployments or zero
    downtime rolling updates.

    Open-source software provisioning,
    configuration management, and application-
    deployment tool.

    It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can
    configure both Unix-like systems as well
    as Microsoft Windows.

    The simplest way to automate apps and IT
    infrastructure.

    Application Deployment + Configuration
    Management + Continuous Delivery.

playbook
    [#ansible]

    A configuration for deployment and
    orchestration, that allows you to describe
    a set of tasks to be run on remote
    machines.
    
    We will need to write a YAML file
    describing the tasks of our deploy.

    Change all your servers through the
    control station.
