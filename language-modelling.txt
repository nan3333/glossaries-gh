whitespace
    This is why GPT-3 cares so much if you end
    your prompt with a space.
    
    When generating most common words, GPT-3
    generates the leading space as part of the
    word.
    
    So when there is a space without a word,
    that is a completely different token.
    
    This typically only occurs in odd
    contexts, leading GPT-3 to generate poor
    quality completions.
