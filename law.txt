    of businesses that team up or form a

    options

indemnity
    An indemnity is a promise by one party to
    compensate another for the loss suffered
    as a consequence of a specific event,

    The trigger event can be anything defined
    by the parties, including:  
    
    - A breach of contract;
    - A party's fault or negligence;
    - A specific action.

    An indemnity operates as a transfer of
    risks between the parties, and changes
    what they would otherwise be liable for or
    entitled to under a normal damage claim.
