shim
    A small library that transparently
    intercepts API calls and changes the
    arguments passed, handles the operation
    itself or redirects the operation
    elsewhere.
    
    Shims can be used to support an old API in
    a newer environment, or a new API in an
    older environment.
    
    Shims can also be used for running
    programs on different software platforms
    than they were developed for.

two's complement
    Negation of a two's complement is
    accomplished by inverting the bits and
    adding 1.

state diagram
    A graphical representation of a set of
    variables and the values they refer to.

stack diagrams

    To keep track of which variables can be
    used where, it is sometimes useful to draw
    a stack diagram.
    
    Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show
    the value of each variable, but they also
    show the function each variable belongs
    to.
    
    Each function is represented by a frame.

    A graphical representation of a stack of
    functions, their variables, and the values
    they refer to.

flow of execution
     The order in which statements are
     executed during a program run.

traceback
     A list of the functions that are
     executing, printed when an exception
     occurs.
    
frame
    [#stack diagram]

    Per function call.

    A frame is a box with the name of a
    function beside it and the parameters and
    variables of the function inside it.

    A box in a stack diagram that represents a
    function call.
    
    It contains the local variables and
    parameters of the function.
