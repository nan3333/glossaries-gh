Issue trees
    Basically maps of problems.
    
    They give you a clear and systematic way
    of looking at the problem you need to
    solve.
    
    They help you break down a big problem
    into smaller, more manageable ones, and
    prioritize certain parts of the problem.
    
    In other words, they're useful for the
    "divide and conquer" strategy.

    Are also great for communicating about a
    problem with others since they provide a
    map of the problem.

    There are two basic kinds of issue trees:

    - Problem trees
      Created by answering "Why?"
    - Solution trees
      Created by answering "How?"

Iceberg model
    Addressing problems only on their event
    level is often not enough.
    
    The real causes are often hidden from
    plain sight.
    
    Iceberg model is a tool that allows you to
    shift your perspective and see beyond the
    immediate events that everyone notices.
    
    It helps you to uncover root causes of why
    those events happen.
    
    That's possible by looking at deeper
    levels of abstraction within the system
    that are not immediately obvious.
