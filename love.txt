agape
agapÄ“
    In the New Testament, the fatherly love of
    God for humans, as well as the human
    reciprocal love for God.
    
    In Scripture, the transcendent agape love
    is the highest form of love and is
    contrasted with eros, or erotic love, and
    philia, or brotherly love.

The Four Loves
    - Storge - empathy bond
    - Philia - friend bond
    - Eros - romantic love
    - Agape - unconditional "God" love

Aristotle
    Love to be a wish for good things to
    happen to another person, with no benefit
    for the subject.
    
    The lover wishes the other's benefit for
    its own sake, without calculating whether
    there is any personal benefit to be drawn.
    
    Thus, love is not measured in terms of its
    practical value as a means to achieve
    certain ends.
    
    For instance, loving someone as a means to
    satisfy one's sexual desire or to become
    rich is partial and transient; the moment
    the end is achieved, or a better means is
    found, love disappears.
    
    Disinterested care is not the same as
    indifference.
    
    Disinterested care implies that the
    beloved is evaluated as having intrinsic
    worth and not as something that may give
    us some future benefits.
