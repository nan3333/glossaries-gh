Biosemiotics
    [field of semiotics and biology]

    Biology interpreted as a sign systems
    study, or, to elaborate, a study of:
    - signification, communication and habit
      formation of living processes
    - semiosis (changing sign relations) in
      living nature
    - the biological basis of all signs and
      sign interpretation

    Studies the prelinguistic meaning-making,
    or production and interpretation of signs
    and codes in the biological realm.

    Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the
    findings of biology and semiotics and
    proposes a paradigmatic shift in the
    scientific view of life, demonstrating
    that semiosis (sign process, including
    meaning and interpretation) is one of its
    immanent and intrinsic features.

semiosphere
    Falls under biosemiotics and is an
    abstract, epiphenomenal, dialogic membrane
    of semiosis, in which sign processes
    operate under the set of all
    interconnected Umwelt.
