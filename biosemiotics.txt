Biosemiotics
    [field of semiotics and biology]

    Biology interpreted as a sign systems
    study, or, to elaborate, a study of:
    - signification, communication and habit
      formation of living processes
    - semiosis (changing sign relations) in
      living nature
    - the biological basis of all signs and
      sign interpretation

    Studies the prelinguistic meaning-making,
    or production and interpretation of signs
    and codes in the biological realm.

    Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the
    findings of biology and semiotics and
    proposes a paradigmatic shift in the
    scientific view of life, demonstrating
    that semiosis (sign process, including
    meaning and interpretation) is one of its
    immanent and intrinsic features.
