Paul
    As a tent maker, he worked with leather,
    and leatherwork is not noisy.
    
    While he worked, therefore, he could have
    talked, and once he was found to have
    something interesting to say, people would
    have dropped by from time to time to
    listen.
    
    It is very probable that Paul spread the
    gospel in this way.
