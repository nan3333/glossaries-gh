level
    Each suffix command is placed on a level
    and each transient has a level (called
    transient-level), which controls which
    suffix commands are available.
    
    Integers between 1 and 7 (inclusive) are
    valid levels.
    
    For suffixes, 0 is also valid; it means
    that the suffix is not displayed at any
    level.
    
    The authors of transients should place
    certain suffixes on a higher level, if
    they expect that it wonâ€™t be of use to
    most users, and they should place very
    important suffixes on a lower level, so
    that they remain available even if the
    user lowers the transient level.

transient
    An abstraction involving a prefix command,
    infix arguments and suffix commands.

    Always involves at least two commands:
    - a prefix
    - a suffix

    Usually has several infix and suffix
    commands.

prefix
    [#transient]

infix
    [#transient]

    Calling an infix command causes its value
    to be changed, possibly by reading a new
    value in the minibuffer.

    Transient supports infix arguments; values
    that are set by infix commands and then
    consumed by the invoked suffix command(s).

suffix
    [#transient]

    Calling a suffix command usually causes
    the transient to be exited but suffix
    commands can also be configured to not
    exit the transient.
