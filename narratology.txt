character arc
    The transformation or inner journey of a
    character over the course of a story.
    
    If a story has a character arc, the
    character begins as one sort of person and
    gradually transforms into a different sort
    of person in response to changing
    developments in the story.
    
    Since the change is often substantive and
    leading from one personality trait to a
    diametrically opposite trait (for example,
    from greed to benevolence), the geometric
    term arc is often used to describe the
    sweeping change.
    
    In most stories, lead characters and
    protagonists are the characters most
    likely to experience character arcs,
    although lesser characters often change as
    well.
    
    A driving element of the plots of many
    stories is that the main character seems
    initially unable to overcome opposing
    forces, possibly because they lack skills
    or knowledge or resources or friends.
    
    To overcome such obstacles, the main
    character must change, possibly by
    learning new skills, to arrive at a higher
    sense of self-awareness or capability.
    
    Main characters can achieve such self-
    awareness by interacting with their
    environment, by enlisting the help of
    mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or
    by some other method.
