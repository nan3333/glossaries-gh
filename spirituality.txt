    The practice of channeling — a person's
    body being taken over by a spirit for the
    purpose of communication — has been around
    for millennia.

    witch doctors, prophets and others who
    claim to hear voices or receive some
    supernatural knowledge from the spirit
    world.

    psychic mediums, often use what are called
    "spirit guides," friendly spirits who give
    them knowledge and help them on their
    spiritual journeys.
