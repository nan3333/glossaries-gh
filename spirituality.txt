spirit
    The part of man that connects and
    communicates with God.
    
    Our spirit differs from our soul because
    our spirit is always pointed toward and
    exists exclusively for God, whereas our
    soul can be self-centered.
    
    The joy, comfort and peace of God's
    presence can only be experienced through
    our spirit.

non-duality
nondualism
nonduality
interconnectedness
nondual awareness
    A fuzzy concept for which many definitions
    can be found,[note 1] including: a
    rejection of dualistic thinking
    originating in Indian philosophy; the
    nondifference of subject and object; the
    common identity of metaphysical phenomena
    and the Absolute; the "nonduality of
    duality and nonduality"; the unity of God
    and man; or simply monism, the
    nonplurality of the world, or double-
    aspect theory.
    
    The recognition that underlying the
    multiplicity and diversity of experience
    there is a single, infinite and
    indivisible reality, whose nature is pure
    consciousness, from which all objects and
    selves derive their apparently independent
    existence.

channeling
    The practice of channeling — a person's
    body being taken over by a spirit for the
    purpose of communication — has been around
    for millennia.
    
    There are countless stories of shamen,
    witch doctors, prophets and others who
    claim to hear voices or receive some
    supernatural knowledge from the spirit
    world.
    
    Channelers, also sometimes known as
    psychic mediums, often use what are called
    "spirit guides," friendly spirits who give
    them knowledge and help them on their
    spiritual journeys.

piety
    A virtue which may include religious
    devotion or spirituality.
    
    A common element in most conceptions of
    piety is a duty of respect.
    
    In a religious context piety may be
    expressed through pious activities or
    devotions, which may vary among countries
    and cultures.

impiety
    Lack of piety or reverence.
    "he blamed the fall of the city on the
    impiety of the people"

    A perceived lack of proper respect for
    something considered sacred.

    Impiety is often closely associated with
    sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a
    physical action.

    Impiety cannot be associated with a cult,
    as it implies a larger belief system was
    disrespected.

godliness
    The quality or state of being spiritually
    pure or virtuous.
