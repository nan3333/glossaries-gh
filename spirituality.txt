praxis
    Key in meditation and spirituality, where
    emphasis is placed on gaining first-hand
    experience of concepts and certain areas,
    such as union with the Divine, which can
    only be explored through praxis due to the
    inability of the finite mind (and its
    tool, language) to comprehend or express
    the infinite.

    In an interview for YES! Magazine, Matthew
    Fox explained it this way: Wisdom is
    always taste-in both Latin and Hebrew, the
    word for wisdom comes from the word for
    taste-so it's something to taste, not
    something to theorize about.

    "Taste and see that God is good", the
    psalm says; and that's wisdom: tasting
    life.

    No one can do it for us.

    The mystical tradition is very much a
    Sophia tradition.

    It is about tasting and trusting
    experience, before institution or dogma.

    According to Strong's Hebrew dictionary,
    the Hebrew word, ta‛am, is; properly a
    taste, that is, (figuratively) perception;
    by implication intelligence; transitively
    a mandate: advice, behaviour, decree,
    discretion, judgment, reason, taste,
    understanding.

disembodiment
    The process of disembodying. A soul,
    spirit, or consciousness that has been
    disembodied, or which otherwise lacks a
    physical form.

soul tie
soul bond
    A phrase which some people use to refer to
    a spiritual connection between two people.
    
    In many cases, it is said to come into
    existence after two people have been
    physically intimate.
    
    In others, it is said to form after an
    intensely close spiritual or emotional
    relationship.

prognostications
    The action of foretelling or prophesying
    future events.

spirit
    The part of man that connects and
    communicates with God.
    
    Our spirit differs from our soul because
    our spirit is always pointed toward and
    exists exclusively for God, whereas our
    soul can be self-centered.
    
    The joy, comfort and peace of God's
    presence can only be experienced through
    our spirit.

non-duality

nonduality
interconnectedness
nondual awareness
    A fuzzy concept for which many definitions
    can be found,[note 1] including: a
    rejection of dualistic thinking
    originating in Indian philosophy; the
    nondifference of subject and object; the
    common identity of metaphysical phenomena
    and the Absolute; the "nonduality of
    duality and nonduality"; the unity of God
    and man; or simply monism, the
    nonplurality of the world, or double-
    aspect theory.
    
    The recognition that underlying the
    multiplicity and diversity of experience
    there is a single, infinite and
    indivisible reality, whose nature is pure
    consciousness, from which all objects and
    selves derive their apparently independent
    existence.

channeling
    The practice of channeling — a person's
    body being taken over by a spirit for the
    purpose of communication — has been around
    for millennia.
    
    There are countless stories of shamen,
    witch doctors, prophets and others who
    claim to hear voices or receive some
    supernatural knowledge from the spirit
    world.
    
    Channelers, also sometimes known as
    psychic mediums, often use what are called
    "spirit guides," friendly spirits who give
    them knowledge and help them on their
    spiritual journeys.

Image of God
imigo dei
    A concept and theological doctrine in
    Christianity, as well as in Judaism.
    
    This concept is a foundational aspect of
    Christian and Jewish understandings of
    human nature.

piety
    A virtue which may include religious
    devotion or spirituality.
    
    A common element in most conceptions of
    piety is a duty of respect.
    
    In a religious context piety may be
    expressed through pious activities or
    devotions, which may vary among countries
    and cultures.

impiety
    Lack of piety or reverence.
    "he blamed the fall of the city on the
    impiety of the people"

    A perceived lack of proper respect for
    something considered sacred.

    Impiety is often closely associated with
    sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a
    physical action.

    Impiety cannot be associated with a cult,
    as it implies a larger belief system was
    disrespected.

godliness
    The quality or state of being spiritually
    pure or virtuous.

karma
    Action, work, or deed.
    
    For the believers in spirituality the term
    also refers to the spiritual principle of
    cause and effect, often descriptively
    called the principle of karma, wherein
    intent and actions of an individual
    (cause) influence the future of that
    individual (effect): Good intent and good
    deeds contribute to good karma and happier
    rebirths, while bad intent and bad deeds
    contribute to bad karma and bad rebirths.
