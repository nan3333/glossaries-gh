channeling
    The practice of channeling — a person's
    body being taken over by a spirit for the
    purpose of communication — has been around
    for millennia.
    
    There are countless stories of shamen,
    witch doctors, prophets and others who
    claim to hear voices or receive some
    supernatural knowledge from the spirit
    world.
    
    Channelers, also sometimes known as
    psychic mediums, often use what are called
    "spirit guides," friendly spirits who give
    them knowledge and help them on their
    spiritual journeys.

piety
    A virtue which may include religious
    devotion or spirituality.
    
    A common element in most conceptions of
    piety is a duty of respect.
    
    In a religious context piety may be
    expressed through pious activities or
    devotions, which may vary among countries
    and cultures.

impiety
    Lack of piety or reverence.
    "he blamed the fall of the city on the
    impiety of the people"

    A perceived lack of proper respect for
    something considered sacred.

    Impiety is often closely associated with
    sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a
    physical action.

    Impiety cannot be associated with a cult,
    as it implies a larger belief system was
    disrespected.
