nisus
    In the system of Gottfried Wilhelm
    Leibniz, the inherent tendency in all
    monads to strive toward the perfect
    realization of their innate and
    appropriate ends.

    See also entelechy.

entelechy
entelechies
    The realization of potential.

    That which realizes or makes actual what
    is otherwise merely potential.

    The concept is intimately connected with
    Aristotle's distinction between matter and
    form, or the potential and the actual.

    The supposed vital principle that guides
    the development and functioning of an
    organism or other system or organization.

    "such self-organization required a special
    biological force-entelechy."

    The soul.

monad
    In the thought of Gottfried Wilhelm
    Leibniz, one of the ultimate indivisible
    units of existence.

    Monads are independent of one another and
    innately have the power of action and
    direction toward some end (see nisus).

    Although no monad in reality acts on any
    other, they work in a divinely
    preestablished harmony so that an
    appearance of causal connection is
    maintained.

    The concept of the monad was intended, in
    part, to address the mind-body problem
    arising from Cartesian dualism.

    "Pen.el is my monad of metaversal
    consciousness"
