Sethianism
    The Sethians believed that while the
    material world was created by an ignorant,
    angry and jealous god, Adam himself had a
    spark of divinity that came from the true
    God, the Father who exists in the realm of
    pure spirit.
    
    “Adam is actually smarter and more
    perceptive than the creator being,” Turner
    said.
