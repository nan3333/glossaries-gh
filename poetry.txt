iambic trimeter
    A line of poetry with three iambs.

iambic tetrameter
    A line of poetry with four iambs.

    - William Wordsworth, "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud"
        I wandered, lonely as a cloud
        That floats on high o’er dales and hills
        When, all at once, I saw a crowd
        A host of golden daffodils.

iambic pentameter
    A line of poetry with five iambs.

iambic hexameter
    A line of poetry with six iambs.

iambic heptameter
    A line of poetry with seven iambs.

iambic meter
    The pattern of a poetic line made up of
    iambs.

    Poetic verse that is made up of iambs,
    which are metrical "feet" with two
    syllables.
    
    In iambic verse, each line consists of one
    or more iambs.
    
    Iambic pentameter is the most common type
    of iambic meter but there are several
    others, as you'll see in the examples
    below.

iamb
iambic
    A metrical foot of poetry consisting of
    two syllables—an unstressed syllable
    followed by a stressed syllable,
    pronounced duh-DUH.
    
    An iamb can be made up of one word with
    two syllables or two different words.

    The words “unite” and “provide” are both
    iambic.
    
    It is the most common meter of poetry in
    English (including all the plays and poems
    of William Shakespeare), as it is closest
    to the rhythms of English speech.

    Examples:
    - exist
    - belong
    - predict
    - away
    - the one
    - we played
    - you know
    - I can’t

trochee
    Pronounced DUH-duh, as in “ladder.”

    A line of verse with one or more trochees
    is said to have a trochaic meter. This
    stress pattern is the opposite of iambic
    meter.

spondee
    Spondees have two stressed syllables,
    pronounced DUH-DUH, as in “TV.” Learn more
    about spondee in our guide here.

dactyl
    Dactyls are pronounced DUH-duh-duh, as in
    “certainly.” This foot has a stressed
    syllable followed by two unstressed
    syllables.

anapest
    Pronounced duh-duh-DUH, as in “what the
    heck!” Anapestic meter typically divides
    its syllables across multiple words.

allegory
    A story, poem, or picture that can be
    interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning,
    typically a moral or political one.

quatrain
    [stanza]

    A quatrain is a type of stanza, or a
    complete poem, consisting of four lines.
    
    Existing in a variety of forms, the
    quatrain appears in poems from the poetic
    traditions of various ancient
    civilizations including Persia, Ancient
    India, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and
    China, and continues into the 21st
    century, where it is seen in works
    published in many languages.
    
    This form of poetry has been continually
    popular in Iran since the medieval period,
    as Ruba'is form an important faction of
    the vast repertoire of Persian poetry,
    with famous poets such as Omar Khayyam and
    Mahsati Ganjavi of Seljuk Persia only
    writing poetry in this format.
    
    Michel de Nostredame (Nostradamus) used
    the quatrain form to deliver his famous
    prophecies in the 16th century.
    
    There are fifteen possible rhyme schemes,
    but the most traditional and common are:
    ABAA, AAAA, ABAB, and ABBA.

abecedarian 
    Related to acrostic, a poem in which the
    first letter of each line or stanza
    follows sequentially through the alphabet.
    
    See Jessica Greenbaum, “A Poem for S.” Tom
    Disch’s “Abecedary” adapts the principles
    of an abecedarian poem, while Matthea
    Harvey’s “The Future of Terror/The Terror
    of Future” sequence also uses the alphabet
    as an organizing principle.
    
    Poets who have used the abecedarian across
    whole collections include Mary Jo Bang, in
    The Bride of E, and Harryette Mullen, in
    Sleeping with the Dictionary.

accentual verse 
    Verse whose meter is determined by the
    number of stressed (accented)
    syllables—regardless of the total number
    of syllables—in each line.
    
    Many Old English poems, including Beowulf,
    are accentual; see Ezra Pound’s modern
    translation of “The Seafarer.” More
    recently, Richard Wilbur employed this
    same Anglo-Saxon meter in his poem “Junk.”
    Traditional nursery rhymes, such as “Pat-
    a-cake, pat-a-cake,” are often accentual.

accentual-syllabic verse 
    Verse whose meter is determined by the
    number and alternation of its stressed and
    unstressed syllables, organized into feet.
    
    From line to line, the number of stresses
    (accents) may vary, but the total number
    of syllables within each line is fixed.
    
    The majority of English poems from the
    Renaissance to the 19th century are
    written according to this metrical system.

acmeism 
    An early 20th-century Russian school of
    poetry that rejected the vagueness and
    emotionality of Symbolism in favor of
    Imagist clarity and texture.
    
    Its proponents included Osip Mandelstam
    and Anna Akhmatova.

acrostic 
    A poem in which the first letter of each
    line spells out a word, name, or phrase
    when read vertically.
    
    See Lewis Carroll’s “A Boat beneath a
    Sunny Sky.”

alcaic 
    A four-line stanza invented by the
    Classical Greek poet Alcaeus that employs
    a specific syllabic count per line and a
    predominantly dactylic meter.
    
    Alfred, Lord Tennyson imitated its form in
    his poem “Milton.”

alexandrine 
    In English, a 12-syllable iambic line
    adapted from French heroic verse.
    
    The last line of each stanza in Thomas
    Hardy’s “The Convergence of the Twain” and
    Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “To a Skylark” is
    an alexandrine.

allegory 
    An extended metaphor in which the
    characters, places, and objects in a
    narrative carry figurative meaning.
    
    Often an allegory’s meaning is religious,
    moral, or historical in nature.
    
    John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress and
    Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene are two
    major allegorical works in English.

alliteration 
    The repetition of initial stressed,
    consonant sounds in a series of words
    within a phrase or verse line.
    
    Alliteration need not reuse all initial
    consonants; “pizza” and “place”
    alliterate.
    
    Example: “With swift, slow; sweet, sour;
    adazzle, dim” from Gerard Manley Hopkins’s
    “Pied Beauty.” Browse poems with
    alliteration.

allusion 
    A brief, intentional reference to a
    historical, mythic, or literary person,
    place, event, or movement.
    
    “The Waste Land,” T.  S.  Eliot’s
    influential long poem is dense with
    allusions.
    
    The title of Seamus Heaney’s
    autobiographical poem “Singing School”
    alludes to a line from W.B.
    
    Yeats’s “Sailing to Byzantium” (“Nor is
    there singing school but studying
    /Monuments of its own magnificence”).
    
    Browse poems with allusions.

ambiguity 
    A word, statement, or situation with two
    or more possible meanings is said to be
    ambiguous.
    
    As poet and critic William Empson wrote in
    his influential book Seven Types of
    Ambiguity (1930), “The machinations of
    ambiguity are among the very roots of
    poetry.” A poet may consciously join
    together incompatible words to disrupt the
    reader’s expectation of meaning, as e.e.
    cummings does in [anyone lived in a pretty
    how town].
    
    The ambiguity may be less deliberate,
    steered more by the poet’s attempts to
    express something ineffable, as in Gerard
    Manley Hopkins’s “The Windhover.” At the
    sight of a bird diving through the air,
    the speaker marvels, “Brute beauty and
    valor and act, oh, air, pride, plume here
    / Buckle!” The ambiguity of this phrase
    lies in the exclamation of “buckle”: The
    verb could be descriptive of the action,
    or it could be the speaker’s imperative.
    
    In both cases, the meaning of the word is
    not obvious from its context.
    
    “Buckle” could mean “fall” or “crumple,”
    or it could describe the act of clasping
    armor and bracing for battle.

anachronism 
    Someone or something placed in an
    inappropriate period of time.
    
    Shakespeare’s placing of a clock in Julius
    Caesar is an anachronism, because clocks
    had not yet been invented in the period
    when the play is set.
    
    In Charles Olson’s epic The Maximus Poems,
    the central figure encompasses the poet’s
    alter ego, the second-century Greek
    philosopher Maximus of Tyre, and the
    fourth-century Phoenician mystic Maximus.
    
    This persona arises from outside of time
    to reflect on the state of American
    culture by recounting the history of
    Gloucester, Massachusetts.

anagram 
    A word spelled out by rearranging the
    letters of another word; for example, “The
    teacher gapes at the mounds of exam pages
    lying before her.” 

anapest 
    A metrical foot consisting of two
    unaccented syllables followed by an
    accented syllable.
    
    The words “underfoot” and “overcome” are
    anapestic.
    
    Lord Byron’s “The Destruction of
    Sennacherib” is written in anapestic
    meter.

anaphora 
    Often used in political speeches and
    occasionally in prose and poetry, anaphora
    is the repetition of a word or words at
    the beginning of successive phrases,
    clauses, or lines to create a sonic
    effect.

    Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I
    Have a Dream” speech, which uses anaphora
    not only in its oft-quoted “I have a
    dream” refrain but throughout, as in this
    passage when he repeats the phrase “go
    back to”:

        Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, 
        go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and
        ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can
        and will be changed.

    In Joanna Klink's poem “Some Feel Rain,”
    the phrase "some feel" is repeated, which
    creates a rhythm and a sense of an
    accumulating emotions and meanings:

        Some feel rain. Some feel the beetle startle
        in its ghost-part when the bark
        slips. Some feel musk. Asleep against
        each other in the whiskey dark, scarcely there.

    See Paul Muldoon’s “As,” William Blake’s
    “The Tyger,” or much of Walt Whitman’s
    poetry, including “I Sing the Body
    Electric.” See also Rebecca Hazelton's
    explanatory essay, “Adventures in
    Anaphora.”

anthropomorphism 
    A form of personification in which human
    qualities are attributed to anything
    inhuman, usually a god, animal, object, or
    concept.
    
    In Vachel Lindsay’s “What the Rattlesnake
    Said,” for example, a snake describes the
    fears of his imagined prey.
    
    John Keats admires a star’s loving
    watchfulness (“with eternal lids apart”)
    in his sonnet “Bright Star, Would I Were
    as Steadfast as Thou Art.”

antithesis 
    Contrasting or combining two terms,
    phrases, or clauses with opposite
    meanings.
    
    William Blake pits love’s competing
    impulses—selflessness and self-
    interest—against each other in his poem
    “The Clod and the Pebble.” Love “builds a
    Heaven in Hell’s despair,” or,
    antithetically, it “builds a Hell in
    Heaven’s despite.”

aphorism 
    A pithy, instructive statement or truism,
    like a maxim or adage.

    See Benjamin Franklin’s “How to get
    RICHES.”

apostrophe 
    An address to a dead or absent person, or
    personification as if he or she were
    present. In his Holy Sonnet “Death, be not
    proud,” John Donne denies death’s power by
    directly admonishing it. Emily Dickinson
    addresses her absent object of passion in
    “Wild nights!—Wild nights!” 

archetype 
    A basic model from which copies are made;
    a prototype.
    
    According to psychologist Carl Jung,
    archetypes emerge in literature from the
    “collective unconscious” of the human
    race.
    
    Northrop Frye, in his Anatomy of
    Criticism, explores archetypes as the
    symbolic patterns that recur within the
    world of literature itself.
    
    In both approaches, archetypical themes
    include birth, death, sibling rivalry, and
    the individual versus society.
    
    Archetypes may also be images or
    characters, such as the hero, the lover,
    the wanderer, or the matriarch.

ars Poetica
    A poem that explains the “art of poetry,”
    or a meditation on poetry using the form
    and techniques of a poem.
    
    Horace’s Ars Poetica is an early example,
    and the foundation for the tradition.
    
    While Horace writes of the importance of
    delighting and instructing audiences,
    modernist ars poetica poets argue that
    poems should be written for their own
    sake, as art for the sake of art.
    
    Archibald MacLeish’s famous “Ars Poetica”
    sums up the argument: “A poem should not
    mean / But be.” See also Alexander Pope’s
    “An Essay on Criticism,” William
    Wordsworth’s Prelude, and Wallace
    Stevens’s “Of Modern Poetry.”

assonance
    The repetition of vowel sounds without
    repeating consonants; sometimes called
    vowel rhyme.
    
    See Amy Lowell’s “In a Garden” (“With its
    leaping, and deep, cool murmur”) or “The
    Taxi” (“And shout into the ridges of the
    wind”).

aubade
    A love poem or song welcoming or lamenting
    the arrival of the dawn.
    
    The form originated in medieval France.
    
    See John Donne’s “The Sun Rising” and
    Louise Bogan’s “Leave-Taking.” Browse more
    aubade poems.

augustan Age
    The first half of the 18th century, during
    which English poets such as Alexander Pope
    and Jonathan Swift emulated Virgil, Ovid,
    and Horace—the great Latin poets of the
    reign of the Emperor Augustus (27 BCE to
    14 CE).
    
    Like the classical poets who inspired
    them, the English Augustan writers engaged
    the political and philosophical ideas of
    their day through urbane, often satirical
    verse.
