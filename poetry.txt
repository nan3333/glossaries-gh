iamb
iambic
    A metrical foot of poetry consisting of
    two syllables—an unstressed syllable
    followed by a stressed syllable,
    pronounced duh-DUH.
    
    An iamb can be made up of one word with
    two syllables or two different words.

    The words “unite” and “provide” are both
    iambic.
    
    It is the most common meter of poetry in
    English (including all the plays and poems
    of William Shakespeare), as it is closest
    to the rhythms of English speech.

    Examples:
    - exist
    - belong
    - predict
    - away
    - the one
    - we played
    - you know
    - I can’t

trochee
    Pronounced DUH-duh, as in “ladder.”

    A line of verse with one or more trochees
    is said to have a trochaic meter. This
    stress pattern is the opposite of iambic
    meter.

spondee
    Spondees have two stressed syllables,
    pronounced DUH-DUH, as in “TV.” Learn more
    about spondee in our guide here.

dactyl
    Dactyls are pronounced DUH-duh-duh, as in
    “certainly.” This foot has a stressed
    syllable followed by two unstressed
    syllables.

anapest
    Pronounced duh-duh-DUH, as in “what the
    heck!” Anapestic meter typically divides
    its syllables across multiple words.

allegory
    A story, poem, or picture that can be
    interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning,
    typically a moral or political one.

quatrain
    [stanza]

    A quatrain is a type of stanza, or a
    complete poem, consisting of four lines.
    
    Existing in a variety of forms, the
    quatrain appears in poems from the poetic
    traditions of various ancient
    civilizations including Persia, Ancient
    India, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and
    China, and continues into the 21st
    century, where it is seen in works
    published in many languages.
    
    This form of poetry has been continually
    popular in Iran since the medieval period,
    as Ruba'is form an important faction of
    the vast repertoire of Persian poetry,
    with famous poets such as Omar Khayyam and
    Mahsati Ganjavi of Seljuk Persia only
    writing poetry in this format.
    
    Michel de Nostredame (Nostradamus) used
    the quatrain form to deliver his famous
    prophecies in the 16th century.
    
    There are fifteen possible rhyme schemes,
    but the most traditional and common are:
    ABAA, AAAA, ABAB, and ABBA.
