quatrain
    [stanza]

    A quatrain is a type of stanza, or a
    complete poem, consisting of four lines.
    
    Existing in a variety of forms, the
    quatrain appears in poems from the poetic
    traditions of various ancient
    civilizations including Persia, Ancient
    India, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and
    China, and continues into the 21st
    century, where it is seen in works
    published in many languages.
    
    This form of poetry has been continually
    popular in Iran since the medieval period,
    as Ruba'is form an important faction of
    the vast repertoire of Persian poetry,
    with famous poets such as Omar Khayyam and
    Mahsati Ganjavi of Seljuk Persia only
    writing poetry in this format.
    
    Michel de Nostredame (Nostradamus) used
    the quatrain form to deliver his famous
    prophecies in the 16th century.
    
    There are fifteen possible rhyme schemes,
    but the most traditional and common are:
    ABAA, AAAA, ABAB, and ABBA.
