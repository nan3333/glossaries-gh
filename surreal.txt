Max Ernst
    (1891-1976)

    A German (naturalised American in 1948 and
    French in 1958) painter, sculptor, graphic
    artist, and poet.

    A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary
    pioneer of the Dada movement and
    surrealism.

    He had no formal artistic training, but
    his experimental attitude toward the
    making of art resulted in his invention of
    frottage-a technique that uses pencil
    rubbings of objects as a source of
    images-and grattage, an analogous
    technique in which paint is scraped across
    canvas to reveal the imprints of the
    objects placed beneath.

    He is also noted for his novels consisting
    of collages.

abstract
abstract art
    Breaking away from the figurative
    representation of objects, abstract art
    reimagines imagery as a study of the
    relationship between shape, form, color,
    and line.

    Abstraction occurs on a continuum,
    including the fractured-yet-recognizable
    forms of Cubism and the totally
    nonpictorial nature of Abstract
    Expressionism.

    A term generally used to describe art that
    is not representational or based on
    external reality or nature.

expressionism
    A modernist movement, initially in poetry
    and painting, originating in Northern
    Europe around the beginning of the 20th
    century.

    Its typical trait is to present the world
    solely from a subjective perspective,
    distorting it radically for emotional
    effect in order to evoke moods or ideas.

abstract expressionism
    The dominant artistic movement in the
    1940s and 1950s, Abstract Expressionism
    was the first to place New York City at
    the forefront of international modern art.

    The associated artists developed greatly
    varying stylistic approaches, but shared a
    commitment to an abstract art that
    powerfully expresses personal convictions
    and profound human values.

    They championed bold, gestural abstraction
    in all mediums, particularly large painted
    canvases.

abstraction
    Non-representational works of art that do
    not depict scenes or objects in the world
    or have discernable subject matter.

appropriation
    As an artistic strategy, the intentional
    borrowing, copying, and alteration of
    preexisting images, objects, and ideas.

Avant-garde
    French for “advanced guard,” this term is
    used in English to describe a group that
    is innovative, experimental, and inventive
    in its technique or ideology, particularly
    in the realms of culture, politics, and
    the arts.

Baroque
    A term meaning extravagant, complex;
    applied to a style in art and architecture
    developed in Europe from the early
    seventeenth to mid-eighteenth century,
    emphasizing dramatic, often strained
    effect and typified by bold, curving
    forms, elaborate ornamentation, and
    overall balance of disparate parts.

biomorphic
    Derived from the Greek words bios (life)
    and morphe (form), a term referring to
    abstract forms or images that evoke
    associations with living forms such as
    plants and the human body.

brushwork
    Brushwork refers to the way a painter
    applies paint to a surface.

    It is typically characterized by the size,
    texture, and precision of the strokes.

    person or thing with exaggerated or
    distorted features, meant to satirize the
    subject.

chiaroscuro
    Italian for “light-dark,” chiaroscuro is
    the use of strong contrasts between
    luminosity and shadow to achieve a sense
    of volume and dimensionality.

    This unique technique was developed during
    the Italian Renaissance by Leonard da
    Vinci, the Baroque period by Caravaggio,
    and the Dutch Golden Age by Rembrandt.

Dada
    An artistic and literary movement formed
    in response to the disasters of World War
    I (1914– 18) and to an emerging modern
    media and machine culture.

    Dada artists sought to expose accepted and
    often-repressive conventions of order and
    logic, favoring strategies of chance,
    spontaneity, and irreverence.

    Dada artists experimented with a range of
    mediums, from collage and photomontage to
    everyday objects and performance,
    exploding typical concepts of how art
    should be made and viewed and what
    materials could be used.

    An international movement born in neutral
    Zurich and New York, Dada rapidly spread
    to Berlin, Cologne, Hannover, Paris, and
    beyond.

Exquisite Corpse
    A game in which each participant takes
    turns writing or drawing on a sheet of
    paper, folds it to conceal his or her
    contribution, then passes it to the next
    player for a further contribution.

    The game gained popularity in artistic
    circles during the 1920s, when it was
    adopted as a technique by artists of the
    Surrealist movement.

Figurative
    A work of art is considered figurative
    when its subject matter is
    representational.

    Representing a form or figure in art that
    retains clear ties to the real world.
