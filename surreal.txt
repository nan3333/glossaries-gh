Max Ernst
    (1891-1976)

    A German (naturalised American in 1948 and
    French in 1958) painter, sculptor, graphic
    artist, and poet.

    A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary
    pioneer of the Dada movement and
    surrealism.

    He had no formal artistic training, but
    his experimental attitude toward the
    making of art resulted in his invention of
    frottage-a technique that uses pencil
    rubbings of objects as a source of
    images-and grattage, an analogous
    technique in which paint is scraped across
    canvas to reveal the imprints of the
    objects placed beneath.

    He is also noted for his novels consisting
    of collages.

abstract
abstract art
    Breaking away from the figurative
    representation of objects, abstract art
    reimagines imagery as a study of the
    relationship between shape, form, color,
    and line.
    
    Abstraction occurs on a continuum,
    including the fractured-yet-recognizable
    forms of Cubism and the totally
    nonpictorial nature of Abstract
    Expressionism.
    
    A term generally used to describe art that
    is not representational or based on
    external reality or nature.

expressionism
    A modernist movement, initially in poetry
    and painting, originating in Northern
    Europe around the beginning of the 20th
    century.
    
    Its typical trait is to present the world
    solely from a subjective perspective,
    distorting it radically for emotional
    effect in order to evoke moods or ideas.

abstract expressionism
    The dominant artistic movement in the
    1940s and 1950s, Abstract Expressionism
    was the first to place New York City at
    the forefront of international modern art.
    
    The associated artists developed greatly
    varying stylistic approaches, but shared a
    commitment to an abstract art that
    powerfully expresses personal convictions
    and profound human values.
    
    They championed bold, gestural abstraction
    in all mediums, particularly large painted
    canvases.
