dialectic
dialectics
dialectical method
minor logic
    A discourse between two or more people
    holding different points of view about a
    subject but wishing to establish the truth
    through reasoned argumentation.
    
    Dialectic resembles debate, but the
    concept excludes subjective elements such
    as emotional appeal and the modern
    pejorative sense of rhetoric.
    
    Dialectic may thus be contrasted with both
    the eristic, which refers to argument that
    aims to successfully dispute another's
    argument (rather than searching for
    truth), and the didactic method, wherein
    one side of the conversation teaches the
    other.
    
    Dialectic is alternatively known as minor
    logic, as opposed to major logic or
    critique.

eristic
    A type of "question-and-answer" teaching
    method popularized by the Sophists, such
    as Euthydemos and Dionysiodoros.
    
    Students learned eristic arguments to
    "refute their opponent, no matter whether
    he [said] yes or no in answer to their
    initial question".
    
    Plato contrasted this type of argument
    with dialectic and other more reasonable
    and logical methods (e.g., at Republic
    454a).
    
    In the dialogue Euthydemus, Plato
    satirizes eristic.
    
    It is more than persuasion, and it is more
    than discourse.
    
    It is a combination that wins an argument
    without regard to truth.
    
    Plato believed that the eristic style "did
    not constitute a method of argument"
    because to argue eristically is to
    consciously use fallacious arguments,
    which therefore weakens one's position.
