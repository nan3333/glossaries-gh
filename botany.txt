    containing a single extant class,
    Pinopsida.

    subset of gymnosperms.

    plants with secondary growth.

    A plant which has foliage that remains
    green and functional through more than one
    growing season.

    their foliage only in warm climates, and
    contrasts with deciduous plants, which
    completely lose their foliage during the
    winter or dry season.
