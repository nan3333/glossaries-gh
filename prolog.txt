    Uses the FFI.

=:=
    [operator]

    Expr1 =:= +Expr2

    True if expression Expr1 evaluates to a
    number equal to Expr2.

    Example:

constraint logic programming
    A form of constraint programming, in which

    concepts from constraint satisfaction.
    
    A constraint logic program is a logic
    program that contains constraints in the
    body of clauses.

declarative reading
concluding reading
    [prolog reading method]

    https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/reading

    Declaratively, Prolog programs state what
    holds.

    A Prolog program consists of clauses, and
    each clause is either a fact or a rule.

    Facts state what is always true.

    Rules state what is true under certain
    conditions.

    A method to reading/understanding prolog
    programs.

    It is easy to explain, understand and use.

    You state what holds under what
    conditions, and the Prolog engine finds
    solutions for you.

    A disadvantage of this approach is that it
    does not explain why logically equivalent
    program variants may exhibit different
    performance or termination
    characteristics.

procedural reading
    [prolog reading method]

    https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/reading

    To complement the declarative approach of
    reading Prolog programs, we can also read
    them procedurally.
    
    This means that we take into account the
    actual computation strategy of the Prolog
    engine.

clause
    Either:
    - fact
    - rule

fact
    State what is always true.

program
    Consists of:
    - theorems
    - axioms

rule
theorem
    State what is true under certain
    conditions. 

axiom
assertion

condition

Prolog
    Extremely well suited for solving
    combinatorial tasks like Sudoku.

predicate
    [#prolog]

    vimlinks +/"magicNumber(7)." "https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/prolog/"

assignment
    [#prolog]
    [operator]

    5 is X+2.

    Unlike =, the right hand side of IS must
    always be bound, thus guaranteeing no
    attempt to solve an equation.

unification
    [#prolog]
    [operator]

    Essentially a combination of assignment
    and equality.

    vimlinks +/"?- 2 = 3." "https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/prolog/"

    If both sides are bound (ie, defined),
    check equality.
    2 = 3

    IMPORTANT (the essence of unification):
    If one side is free (ie, undefined),
    assign to match the other side.
    X = 3

    If both sides are free, the assignment is
    remembered. With some luck, one of the two
    sides will eventually be bound, but this
    isn't necessary.
    X = Y are both free, so Prolog remembers
    it. Therefore assigning X will also assign
    Y. IS is another assigment operator in prolog.
    X = Y, X = 2, Z is Y + 3.

member
    [predicate]

    Fundamental Prolog tool for manipulating
    lists.

->
    :Condition -> :Action

    If -> Then; _Else :- If, !, Then.

    X == Y -> write(X).

    If X equals Y then write X to the
    terminal.

[]
    [atom]
    [list]

    A list, denoting the empty list.
    
clean
    When representing data with Prolog terms,
    ask yourself the following question:     
    - Can I distinguish the kind of each
      component from its principal functor? 
    
    If this holds, your representation is
    called clean.

defaulty
    If you cannot distinguish the elements by
    their principal functor, your
    representation is called defaulty.

    A wordplay combining "default" and
    "faulty".
    
    This is because reasoning about your data
    will need a "default case", which is
    applied if everything else fails.
    
    In addition, such a representation
    prevents argument indexing, and is
    considered faulty due to this shortcoming.
    
    Always aim to avoid defaulty
    representations! Aim for cleaner
    representations instead 

standard operators
    Several standard operators are predefined.

    For example, you can write a+b and X=Y
    instead of +(a,b) and =(X,Y),
    respectively. 

principal functor
    Compound terms are defined inductively as
    follows:

    If T1, T2, ..., TN are terms, then F(T1,
    T2, ..., TN) is also a term, where F is
    called a functor name and adheres to the
    same syntax rules as atoms.

    F/N is called the principal functor of the
    compound term, and N is called the arity.

    Examples:
    - f(a), g(f(X)) and
    - + (a, f(X)).

list

mutation
destructive modifications
    Alien to logic programming.
    
    In Prolog, we describe relations between
    entities, not destructive effects.
    
    To express a change in a Prolog data
    structure, we define a predicate that
    relates the state of the structure before
    the change to a different structure after
    the change.
    
    For this reason, pure modifications often
    entail some copying of data and typically
    lead to at least logarithmic overhead (for
    example, to copy a subtree of a balanced
    tree)

argument indexing
    The above is a clean representation: It
    lets us distinguish the kinds of elements
    by their principal functor.
    
    We can reason about such trees in a way
    that keeps the code very general and
    usable in all directions.
    
    Such a representation is also amenable to
    argument indexing. 

Term inspection
    In Prolog, the most natural way to reason
    about terms is to rely on unification.
    
    In addition, there are several predicates
    that let you decompose and analyze terms.
    
    The most important of these term
    inspection predicates are functor/3, arg/3
    and (=..)/2 

macro
    Code is more than data.

    Macros are a lot easier to write in Prolog
    for several reasons.
    
    For example, you do not have to quote
    Prolog code when reasoning about it or
    generating it, and you cannot accidentally
    run into name clashes with different
    variables
