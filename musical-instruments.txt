buisine
    [musical instrument]

    The buisine was a type of straight
    medieval trumpet usually made of metal,
    also called a herald's trumpet.
    
    It had a very long and slender body,
    usually one to two metres in length that
    tapered toward the end into a slightly
    flared bell.
