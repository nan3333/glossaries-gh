aspect-oriented software development
aspect-oriented programming
AOP
    Aims to increase modularity by allowing
    the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
    
    It does so by adding additional behavior
    to existing code (an advice) without
    modifying the code itself, instead
    separately specifying which code is
    modified via a "pointcut" specification,
    such as "log all function calls when the
    function's name begins with 'set'".
    
    This allows behaviors that are not central
    to the business logic (such as logging) to
    be added to a program without cluttering
    the code core to the functionality.
