John Chrysostom
    An important Early Church Father who
    served as archbishop of Constantinople.
    
    He is known for his preaching and public
    speaking, his denunciation of abuse of
    authority by both ecclesiastical and
    political leaders, Divine Liturgy of Saint
    John Chrysostom, and his ascetic
    sensibilities.
    
    The epithet Χρυσόστομος (Chrysostomos,
    anglicized as Chrysostom) means "golden-
    mouthed" in Greek and denotes his
    celebrated eloquence.
    
    Chrysostom was among the most prolific
    authors in the early Christian Church,
    although both Origen of Alexandria and
    Augustine of Hippo exceeded Chrysostom.
