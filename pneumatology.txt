pneumatology
    Refers to a particular discipline within
    Christian theology that focuses on the
    study of the Holy Spirit.
    
    The term is derived from the Greek word
    Pneuma, which designates "breath" or
    "spirit" and metaphorically describes a
    non-material being or influence.
