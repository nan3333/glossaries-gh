hamartiology
    A branch of Christian theology which is
    the study of sin, describes sin as an act
    of offence against God by despising his
    persons and Christian biblical law, and by
    injuring others.

    Christian hamartiology is closely related
    to concepts of natural law, moral theology
    and Christian ethics.

pride
    One sense of the word 'pride' is exalting
    thyself.

    The word 'pride' has too wide a semantic
    demain to be called a sin. Conceit, most
    centainly.

    Some senses of pride are not sinful:
        “I have the highest confidence in you,
        and I take great pride in you. You
        have greatly encouraged me and made me
        happy despite all our troubles”
        (2 Corinthians 7:4, NLT).
