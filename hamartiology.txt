hamartiology
    A branch of Christian theology which is
    the study of sin, describes sin as an act
    of offence against God by despising his
    persons and Christian biblical law, and by
    injuring others.

    Christian hamartiology is closely related
    to concepts of natural law, moral theology
    and Christian ethics.
