hamartiology
    A branch of Christian theology which is
    the study of sin, describes sin as an act
    of offence against God by despising his
    persons and Christian biblical law, and by
    injuring others.

    Christian hamartiology is closely related
    to concepts of natural law, moral theology
    and Christian ethics.

pride
    The quality or state of being proud.

    The word 'pride' has too wide a semantic
    demain to be universally called a sin;
    Conceit and self-exaltation most centainly
    are sinful.

    As a sin or vice:
    - Inordinate self-esteem
    - Exalting thyself
    - Conceit

    Reasonable or justifiable pride:
    - Respect, delight or elation arising from some
      personal act, possession, or relationship,
      under God.
    - (2 Corinthians 7:4, NLT).
      “I have the highest confidence in you,
      and I take great pride in you. You have
      greatly encouraged me and made me happy
      despite all our troubles”
