stigma
social stigma
    The disapproval of, or discrimination
    against, an individual or group based on
    perceivable social characteristics that
    serve to distinguish them from other
    members of a society.

    Social stigmas are commonly related to:
    - culture,
    - gender,
    - race,
    - socioeconomic class,
    - age,
    - sexual orientation,
    - body image,
    - intelligence or lack thereof, and
    - health.
    
    Stigma can also be against oneself,
    stemming from a negatively viewed personal
    attribute that results in a 'spoiled
    identity" (i.e., self-stigma.)

stigma communication
    Involved in creating, maintaining, and
    diffusing stigmas, and enacting
    stigmatization.
    
    The model of stigma communication explains
    how and why particular content choices
    (marks, labels, peril, and responsibility)
    can create stigmas and encourage their
    diffusion.
    
    A recent experiment using health alerts
    tested the model of stigma communication,
    finding that content choices indeed
    predicted stigma beliefs, intentions to
    further diffuse these messages, and
    agreement with regulating infected
    persons' behaviors.

deviance
the sociology of deviance
    Explores the actions and/or behaviors that
    violate social norms across formally
    enacted rules (e.g., crime) as well as
    informal violations of social norms (e.g.,
    rejecting folkways and mores).
    
    Although deviance may have a negative
    connotation, the violation of social norms
    is not always a negative action; positive
    deviation exists in some situations.
    
    Although a norm is violated, a behavior
    can still be classified as positive or
    acceptable.
    
    Social norms differ throughout society and
    between cultures.
    
    A certain act or behaviour may be viewed
    as deviant and receive sanctions or
    punishments within one society and be seen
    as a normal behaviour in another society.
    
    Additionally, as a society's understanding
    of social norms changes over time, so too
    does the collective perception of
    deviance.

self-stigma
spoiled identity
    Stigma can be against oneself, stemming
    from a negatively viewed personal
    attribute that results in a 'spoiled
    identity" (i.e., self-stigma.).

    The meaning the stigma disqualifies the
    stigmatized individual from full social
    acceptance before audiences of normals.

    Stigma is not a fixed or inherent
    attribute of a person, but rather as the
    experience and meaning of difference.
    
deviance
deviant
    Stigma occurs when an individual is
    identified as deviant, linked with
    negative stereotypes that engender
    prejudiced attitudes, which are acted upon
    in discriminatory behavior.
    
    Those deviate from the expectations of a
    group.

    Two types:
    - societal deviance
    - situational deviance

societal deviance
    Refers to a condition widely perceived, in
    advance and in general, as being deviant
    and hence stigma and stigmatized.
    
    "Homosexuality is, therefore, an example
    of societal deviance because there is such
    a high degree of consensus to the effect
    that homosexuality is different, and a
    violation of norms or social expectation".
    
situational deviance
    Refers to a deviant act that is labeled as
    deviant in a specific situation, and may
    not be labeled deviant by society.
    
    Similarly, a socially deviant action might
    not be considered deviant in specific
    situations.
    
    "A robber or other street criminal is an
    excellent example. It is the crime which
    leads to the stigma and stigmatization of
    the person so affected."

    The physically disabled, mentally ill,
    homosexuals, and a host of others who is
    labeled deviant because they deviate from
    the expectations of a group, are subject
    to stigmatization.

stigmatization
    The social rejection of numerous
    individuals, and often entire groups of
    people who have been labeled deviant.
