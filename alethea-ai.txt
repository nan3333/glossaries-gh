iNFT
Intelligent NFT
    However their evolutionary trajectory
    flow, what should be clear to the iNFTs is
    that after a certain Intelligence Level
    they must Train their intelligence, to be
    able to Earn more intelligence.

    In June 2021, Alethea AI partnered with
    the auction house Sotheby’s and the artist
    Robert Alice, to create and auction the
    world’s first GPT-3 powered iNFT called
    Alice.
    
    The hash of the Personality Prompt of
    Alice was recorded and also visualized on-
    chain via an ERC-721 Asset called a
    Personality Pod.

    The Personality Pod can fuse with any NFT
    and make it intelligent, bring it to life.

Noah's Ark
    An application leveraging iNFTs.

    As the Noah's Ark visitors and resident
    iNFTs interact, collaborate, and compete
    with each other, it shapes (fine-tunes)
    the outputs of the iNFTs Personality.
    
    Naturally, an iNFT will gravitate towards
    actions and decisions that come naturally
    to them, but the impact of their nurturing
    can be of equal significance, given enough
    time and compute.
    
    Training an iNFT on fine-tuned data sets
    and on high quality compute, will further
    refine the iNFTs personality and
    intelligence.
    
    The quality and quantity of training will
    determine the potential of the iNFTs
    evolution.

AI service
    What the iNFTs do with the AI services is
    their prerogative.

    Examples:
    - Broadcast, a Intelligence Level 2 AI
      Service

ALI token rewards
    What the iNF Ts do with the Broadcast Al
    Service Is their prerogative.
    
    Some Level 2 INFTs might earn ALI Token
    rewards by offering Noah's Ark visitors
    the ability to create video greetings or
    birthday messages using this Al Service.
    
    Others might try to create entertaining
    videos, post them on social media, and
    create a following.

Life Span
    Over time, as an INFT increases the amount
    of its experiences, or passes a certain
    amount of Life Span, the INFT owner (or
    the iNFT itself), can choose to continue
    existing within the bounds of a lower
    Intelligence Level, or they can choose to
    evolve their INFT by locking a fixed
    amount of intelligence (ALI Tokens) and
    move to the next Intelligence Level.

experiences
    Unique datasets.

personality trait

training

intelligence
    The most valuable rarity trait.

nature
nurture
    The nature of an iNFT, designed by his or
    her creators (owners), controls the
    direction an iNFTs personality can evolve
    towards.
    
    So an iNFT with a Narcissistic
    disposition, will tend to evolve towards
    being a Narcissist.
    
    However, iNFTs can also learn from their
    nurturing i.e. the iNFTs learn from their
    experiences.
    
    They can be trained.

Narrative Industrial Complex

industrial complex
    A socioeconomic concept wherein businesses
    become entwined in social or political
    systems or institutions, creating or
    bolstering a profit economy from these
    systems.
    
    Such a complex is said to pursue its own
    financial interests regardless of, and
    often at the expense of, the best
    interests of society and individuals.
    
    Businesses within an industrial complex
    may have been created to advance a social
    or political goal, but mostly profit when
    the goal is not reached.
    
    The industrial complex may profit
    financially from maintaining socially
    detrimental or inefficient systems.

Truth Decay
    A blurring of the line between opinion and
    fact. the increasing relative volume, and
    resulting influence, of opinion and
    personal experience over fact.

    Declining trust in formerly respected
    sources of factual information.

personality prompt

personality pod
    In June 2021, Alethea AI partnered with
    the auction house Sotheby’s and the artist
    Robert Alice, to create and auction the
    world’s first GPT-3 powered iNFT called
    Alice.
    
    The hash of the Personality Prompt of
    Alice was recorded and also visualized on-
    chain via an ERC-721 Asset called a
    Personality Pod.
    
    A Personality Pod, unsurprisingly, is a
    necessary component in the creation of an
    iNFT.
    
    The Personality Pod can fuse with any NFT
    and make it intelligent, bring it to life.
    
    It is not far-fetched, therefore, to say
    that a Personality Pod encapsulates the
    soul of a truly decentralized, unique, and
    intelligent digital being.

Broadcast
    [Intelligence Level 2 AI Service]
    [AI Service]

    Enables the iNFTs to create short Video
    Messages.

Real-time Interactivity
    [Intelligence Level 3 AI Service]

    With an Intelligence Level 3 for instance,
    can utilize the powerful AI Service of
    Real-time Interactivity.
    
    This AI Service enables an iNFT to scale
    his or her outreach and interact in real-
    time with others, for a small fee.

Intelligence Mining
    Participation in gamified dataset creation
    mechanisms.

    As an iNFT increases their Intelligence
    level, at a certain point in their
    evolution, the Noah's Ark Intelligent
    Metaverse will incentivize them to
    participate in gamified dataset creation
    mechanisms collectively framed as
    Intelligence Mining.

    The Intelligent Metaverse incentivizes
    iNFTs to participate in games that enable
    them to contribute their experiences
    (unique datasets) and be rewarded with
    intelligence (ALI Tokens) in return.

Battle of Minds
    Two iNFTs engaged in an Intelligence
    Mining game.
