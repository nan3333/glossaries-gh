    In June 2021, Alethea AI partnered with
    the auction house Sotheby’s and the artist
    Robert Alice, to create and auction the
    world’s first GPT-3 powered iNFT called
    Alice.
    
    The hash of the Personality Prompt of
    Alice was recorded and also visualized on-
    chain via an ERC-721 Asset called a
    Personality Pod.
    
    A Personality Pod, unsurprisingly, is a
    necessary component in the creation of an
    iNFT.
    
    The Personality Pod can fuse with any NFT
    and make it intelligent, bring it to life.
    
    It is not far-fetched, therefore, to say
    that a Personality Pod encapsulates the
    soul of a truly decentralized, unique, and
    intelligent digital being.
