New Age wisdom
    A philosophy in spiritual New Age wisdom
    is you are a spiritual being manifesting
    consciousness.
    
    If you accept an aspect of who you really
    are, you can live out your life in a state
    of unconditional abundance and health.
    
    Knowing this is knowledge.
    
    Applying it to your world is spiritual
    wisdom.

    Personally, I do not believe this is the
    spirit of wisdom; New-age wisdom seems to
    be vapid.
