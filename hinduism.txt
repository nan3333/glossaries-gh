Vishnu
    The preserver and protector of the
    universe.
    
    His role is to return to the earth in
    troubled times and restore the balance of
    good and evil.
    
    So far, he has been incarnated nine times,
    but Hindus believe that he will be
    reincarnated one last time close to the
    end of this world.
