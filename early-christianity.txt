Bridal Chamber
Mystery of the Bridal Chamber
    Now known from the Gospel of Philip and
    other Nag Hammadi texts:
    - becoming one with the Bridegroom

    Establishing the germ of light in the
    bridal chamber.

    Receiving grace and the Spirit.

    Because of this Christ came, in order that
    he might remove the separation which was
    from the beginning, and again unite the
    two; and that he might give life to those
    who died in the separation, and unite
    them.
