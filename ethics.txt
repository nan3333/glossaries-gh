ethics
    Many people think of morality as something
    that's personal and normative, whereas
    ethics is the standards of “good and bad”
    distinguished by a certain community or
    social setting.

cognitivism
    The meta-ethical view that ethical
    sentences express propositions and can
    therefore be true or false (they are
    truth-apt), which noncognitivists deny.
    
    Cognitivism is so broad a thesis that it
    encompasses (among other views) moral
    realism (which claims that ethical
    sentences express propositions about mind-
    independent facts of the world), ethical
    subjectivism (which claims that ethical
    sentences express propositions about
    peoples' attitudes or opinions), and error
    theory (which claims that ethical
    sentences express propositions, but that
    they are all false, whatever their
    nature).
