HIV
AIDS
    HIV is incurable due to the presence of a
    latent viral reservoir.
    
    During the life cycle of the virus, HIV
    integrates into the host DNA.
    
    A subset of integrated HIV provirus
    remains transcriptionally silent,
    producing neither viral proteins nor viral
    progeny, until reactivation by various
    physiologic stimuli.
