Charis
    In the system of Valentinus, was an
    alternative name, with Ennoea and Sige,
    for the consort of the primary Aeon
    Bythos.
    
    The name expresses that aspect of the
    absolute Greatness in which it is regarded
    not as a solitary monad, but as imparting
    from its perfection to beings of which it
    is the ultimate source; and this is the
    explanation given in the Valentinian
    fragment preserved by Epiphanius.
    
    The use of the word Charis enabled
    Ptolemaeus to find in John 1:14 the first
    tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes,
    Charis, Aletheia.
    
    The suspicion arises that it was with a
    view to such an identification that names
    to be found in the prologue of St.
    
    John's Gospel were added as alternative
    appellations to the original names of the
    Aeons.
    
    But this is a point on which we have no
    data to pronounce.
    
    Charis has an important place in the
    system of Marcus.
    
    The name Charis appears also in the system
    of the Barbelitae, but as denoting a later
    emanation than in the Valentinian system.
    
    The word has possibly also a technical
    meaning in the Ophite prayers preserved by
    Origen, all of which end with the
    invocation he charis synesto moi, nai
    pater, synesto.

cosmos
    Employing a third concept of cosmos, what
    is manifest, Valentinian initiates could
    exegete scripture in light of these three
    aspects of correlated existence.

kenoma
    Emptiness.

    Valentinius, a mid-2nd century Gnostic
    thinker and preacher, was among the early
    Christians who attempted to align
    Christianity with middle Platonism.
    
    Valentinius pooled dual concepts from the
    Platonic world of ideal forms, or fullness
    (pleroma), and the lower world of
    phenomena, or emptiness (kenoma, κένωμα).
    
    Employing a third concept of cosmos, what
    is manifest, Valentinian initiates could
    exegete scripture in light of these three
    aspects of correlated existence.

hysterema
    The usual antithesis to Pleroma is not
    Kenoma, but Hysterema (ὑστέρημα).
    
    As the system is reported by Hippolytus
    (vi. 31, p. 180) this word is used as the
    complement of the word Pleroma, denoting
    all that is not included in the meaning of
    the latter word.
    
    Thus the Horos or boundary is described as
    separating the Hysterema from the Pleroma,
    itself partaking of the nature of both;
    but preserving all inside fixed and
    immovable by permitting nothing from
    without to enter.
    
    We can understand in the same sense the
    passage in Epiphanius (Haer. 31, 4, p.
    166), where the same name is given to the
    Demiurge; for it appears in the case of
    the word Hebdomas that the Valentinians
    gave to the Demiurge the name of the realm
    over which he ruled, and from which he had
    his origin.
    
    Marcus speaks of the Demiurge as karpos
    hysterematos probably, as Lightfoot
    suggests, in contrast with the description
    of the Christ as karpos pleromatos.

hyleticism

    The sickness of materialism.

psychism
    [sickness]

type

image
    Valentinians believed that when they came
    to earth they were also separated from
    their divine reality and thus became
    images.
    
    Irenaeus taught that when Valentinians “at
    last achieve perfection, [they] shall be
    given as brides to the angels of the
    Savior” (Against Heresies 1.7.5).
    
    Rather than being a marriage where a man
    and a woman are united, the Valentinian
    bridal chamber was a place where
    individuals were united with their divine
    self, their angel.

icon
    An icon (from Ancient Greek εἰκών (eikṓn)
    'image, resemblance') is a religious work
    of art, most commonly a painting, in the
    cultures of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental
    Orthodox, the Roman Catholic, and Eastern
    Catholic churches.
    
    They are not simply artworks; "an icon is
    a sacred image used in religious
    devotion".
    
    The most common subjects include Christ,
    Mary, saints and angels.

Left
Right
The Left
The Right
    Material elements = the "left".

    Soul = the "right".

    Unlike the Sethians who taught a dualism
    between matter and spirit, Valentinians
    taught that the structure of the universe
    is tripartite.
    
    In their view, the cosmos consists of
    three distinct components: spirit
    (pneuma), soul (psyche) and matter (hyle).
    
    This tripartite division is also applied
    to human beings.
    
    Every human being is said to consist of
    three components: a material body, an
    animating soul, and a spirit.

visio dei
visio verbi dei
visio beatifica
beatific vision
    According to Matt 5:8, the visio Dei or
    vision of God is a promised good; Paul
    contrasts the eschatological vision “face
    to face” (1 Cor 13:12) to the broken,
    fragmentary perception of faith in the
    present (cf. 2 Cor 5:7).
    
    Against the background of the Platonic
    notion of participation through knowledge,
    Augustine of Hippo developed a doctrine of
    the visio Dei as the epitome of the
    eternal frui Deo (“enjoyment of God”)
    granted to the redeemed.

patristic
    Relating to the early Christian
    theologians or to patristics.

papyrological
    The study of ancient texts from Egypt
    written on papyrus as well as potsherds,
    wooden tablets, etc.
    
    The dry sands of Egypt have preserved
    hundreds of thousands of these texts.
    
    The writing material was made from the
    stem of the Egyptian papyrus plant.

syzygy
    The notion of the pair or "syzygy" is
    central to Valentinian thought.
    
    The term refers to the linking together of
    complementary qualities ("Aeons") of to
    form a state of wholeness (pleroma).
    
    This is the highest level of reality.
    
    The halves of a syzygy are often refered
    to as male and female.
    
    The male corresponds to form and the
    female corresponds to substance.
    
    God can be understood to consist of four
    primary pairs or syzygies:

    - Depth and Silence (unknowable God),
    - Mind and Truth (comprehensible God),
    - Word and Life (active God),
    - Humanity and Church (immanent God).
