visio dei
visio verbi dei
visio beatifica
beatific vision
    According to Matt 5:8, the visio Dei or
    vision of God is a promised good; Paul
    contrasts the eschatological vision “face
    to face” (1 Cor 13:12) to the broken,
    fragmentary perception of faith in the
    present (cf. 2 Cor 5:7).
    
    Against the background of the Platonic
    notion of participation through knowledge,
    Augustine of Hippo developed a doctrine of
    the visio Dei as the epitome of the
    eternal frui Deo (“enjoyment of God”)
    granted to the redeemed.

patristic
    Relating to the early Christian
    theologians or to patristics.

papyrological
    The study of ancient texts from Egypt
    written on papyrus as well as potsherds,
    wooden tablets, etc.
    
    The dry sands of Egypt have preserved
    hundreds of thousands of these texts.
    
    The writing material was made from the
    stem of the Egyptian papyrus plant.

syzygy
    The notion of the pair or "syzygy" is
    central to Valentinian thought.
    
    The term refers to the linking together of
    complementary qualities ("Aeons") of to
    form a state of wholeness (pleroma).
    
    This is the highest level of reality.
    
    The halves of a syzygy are often refered
    to as male and female.
    
    The male corresponds to form and the
    female corresponds to substance.
    
    God can be understood to consist of four
    primary pairs or syzygies:

    - Depth and Silence (unknowable God),
    - Mind and Truth (comprehensible God),
    - Word and Life (active God),
    - Humanity and Church (immanent God).
