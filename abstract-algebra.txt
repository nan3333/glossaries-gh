function machine metaphor
    We can view a function as something that
    can take an object (as long as the object
    is in its domain) and turn it into (or map
    it to) a different object. We can imagine
    it is some machine that does this
    transformation.

codomain
set of destination of a function
codomain of a function
    The set of its possible outputs. In the
    function machine metaphor, the codomain is
    the set of objects that might possible
    come out of the machine. For example, when
    we use the function notation f:R→R, we
    mean that f is a function from the real
    numbers to the real numbers.

    The set into which all of the output of
    the function is constrained to fall. It is
    the set Y in the notation f: X → Y. The
    term range is sometimes ambiguously used
    to refer to either the codomain or image
    of a function.

identity morphism
    A unique morphism corresponding to each
    object of a category, which has its domain
    equal to its codomain, and which composed
    with any morphism (with which it is
    composable) gives that same morphism.

isomorphic
isomorphism
    [retaining structure bijective]

    One morphism and another morphism, so that
    the recombination of the two is an
    identity morphism.

    It indicates a structure preserving map
    between two sets containing the same
    number of elements.

diffeomorphism
    [mathematics]

    An isomorphism of smooth manifolds.

    It is an invertible function that maps one
    differentiable manifold to another such
    that both the function and its inverse are
    smooth.

binomial distribution
    Only 2 possible outcomes on any one
    individual trial; typically,
    - success
    - failure

homomorphism
    Like an isomorphism but instead is when
    the map is from a larger set to a smaller
    one.

poincare duality [theorem]
    A basic result on the structure of the
    homology and cohomology groups of
    manifolds. It states that if M is an
    n-dimensional oriented closed manifold
    (compact and without boundary), then the
    kth cohomology Group of M is isomorphic to
    the (n − k)th homology Group of M, for all
    integers k

    Holds for any coefficient Ring, so long as
    one has taken an orientation with respect
    to that coefficient Ring;
        in particular, since every manifold
        has a unique orientation mod 2,
        Poincaré duality holds mod 2 without
        any assumption of orientation.

Group-like Structures
    Examples:
    - Magma
    - Semigroup
    - Monoid
    - Group
    - Abelian group
    - Idempotent group

Magma
    [Group-like structure]

    A set with a (closed) binary operation.

    (A, *)

    Structure:
    * : A × A → A

Semigroup
    [Group-like structure]

    A Magma where the operation is
    associative.

    (A, *)

    Structure:
    * : A × A → A

    Laws:
    ∀x, y, z ∈ A; x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z

Monoid
    [Group-like structure]

    A Semigroup with an identity element.

    (A, *,u)

    Structure:
    * : A × A → A
    u : A

    Laws:
    (A, *) is a Semigroup
    ∀x ∈ A; x * u = u * x = x

Group
    [Group-like structure]

    A Monoid that has inverses relative to the
    operation.

    (A, *,u, ′)

    Structure:
    * : A × A → A
    u : A
    ′ : A → A

    Laws:
    (A, *,u) is a Monoid
    ∀x ∈ A; x * x′ = x′ * x = u

    Laws:
    1. Closure:
       If A and B are two elements in G, then
       the product AB is also in G.
    2. Associativity:
       The defined multiplication is
       associative, i.e., for all A,B,C in G,
       (AB)C=A(BC).
    3. Identity:
       There is an identity element I (a.k.a.
       1, E, or e) such that IA=AI=A for every
       element A in G.
    4. Inverse:
       There must be an inverse (a.k.a.
       reciprocal) of each element. Therefore,
       for each element A of G, the set
       contains an element B=A^(-1) such that
       AA^(-1)=A^(-1)A=I.

Abelian group
    [Group-like structure]

    A Group where the operation is also
    commutative.
    
    You may also see the term abelian applied
    to semigroups and monoids whose operations
    are commutative.

    Laws:
    ∀x, y ∈ A; x * y = y * x

    This is in addition to the laws for
    Semigroup, Monoid, or Group (whichever
    abelian structure you’re dealing with)
    that already pertain.

non-Abelian group
noncommutative group
    A Group for which the commutativity axiom
    does not hold, i.e. for arbitrary two
    elements m and n of the Group (G, *) the
    equation m*n = n*m does not hold.

Idempotent group
    [Group-like structure]

    A Group whose operation is idempotent.
    
    Strictly speaking, an Idempotent group is
    necessarily trivial – that is, it is
    necessarily a Group with only one element.
    
    As with abelian, idempotent may apply to
    semigroups or monoids as well when the
    operation is idempotent.

    Laws:
    ∀x ∈ A; x * x = x

Ring-like Structures
    Examples:
    - Quasiring
    - Nearring
    - Semiring
    - Rng
    - Ring
    - Division algebra
    - Field

Quasiring
    [Ring-like structure]

    Two monoids over the same set whose Monoid
    structures are compatible, in the sense
    that:
    - one operation (called multiplication)
      distributes over the other (called
      addition), and
    - the additive identity is a
      multiplicative annihilator.

    (A, +,⋅,0, 1)

    Structure:
    + : A × A → A
    ⋅ : A × A → A
    0 : A
    1 : A

    Laws:
    (A, +,0) is a Monoid
    (A, ⋅,1) is a Monoid
    ∀x ∈ A; 0 ⋅ x = x ⋅ 0 = 0
    ∀x, y, z ∈ A; x ⋅ (y + z) = x ⋅ y + x ⋅ z
    ∀x, y, z ∈ A; (x + y) ⋅ z = x ⋅ z + y ⋅ z

Nearring
    [Ring-like structure]

    A Quasiring with additive inverses.

    (A, +,⋅,0, 1,  − )

    Structure:
    + : A × A → A
    ⋅ : A × A → A
    0 : A
    1 : A
     −  : A → A

    Laws:
    (A, +,0,  − ) is a Group

Semiring
    [Ring-like structure]

    A Quasiring with commutative addition.
    
    Alternatively, a Ring without inverses,
    hence also sometimes called a rig, i.e., a
    Ring without negatives.

    Quasiring (A, +,⋅,0, 1)

    Laws:
    (A, +,0) is abelian

Rng
    [Ring-like structure]

    A Ring without identities.

    If we may speak frankly, the rig and Rng
    nomenclatures are abominations.
    
    Nevertheless, you may see them sometimes,
    but we will speak of them no more.

Ring
    [Ring-like structure]

    A Quasiring that is both a Nearring and a
    Semiring.
    
    Alternatively, Abelian group plus a Monoid
    (over the same set) where the Monoid
    operation is distributive over the Group
    operation.

    Nearring (A, +,⋅,0, 1,  − )

    Laws:
    (A, +,0,  − ) is an Abelian group

    Rings, semirings, and the lot can also be
    commutative rings, commutative semirings,
    etc., but, unlike the Group-like
    structures, they are not usually described
    as, e.g., “abelian rings.”

Division algebra
    [Ring-like structure]

    A Ring with multiplicative inverses.

    (A, +,⋅,0, 1, −,′)

    Structure:
    + : A × A → A
    ⋅ : A × A → A
    0 : A
    1 : A
    − : A → A
    ′ : A \ {0} → A \ {0}

    The notation A \ {0}, sometimes
    alternatively given as A − {0}, means
    “everything in A except 0.”

    Laws:
    (A, +,⋅,0, 1,  − ) is a Ring
    (A \ {0}, 1, ′) is a Group

Field
    [Ring-like structure]

    A Division algebra with commutative
    multiplication.

    Division algebra (A, +,⋅,0, 1, −,′)

    Laws:
    (A, +,⋅,0, 1) is commutative

Lattice-like Structures
    Examples:
    - Semilattice
    - Lattice
    - Bounded lattice
    - Complemented lattice
    - Distributive lattice
    - Heyting algebra
    - Boolean algebra

Semilattice
    [Lattice-like structure]

    A Magma where the operation is
    commutative, associative, and idempotent.
    
    It could refer to either of the abelian
    semigroups of a Lattice, written ∨ and
    often called join or Boolean or, and ∧
    often called meet or Boolean and.
    
    We define the term here for reasons
    related to its usage in Haskell, but it is
    best understood in context of lattices,
    rather than independently.

Lattice
    [Lattice-like structure]

    Two idempotent abelian semigroups over the
    same set whose Semigroup structures are
    compatible, in the sense that the
    operations satisfy absorption laws.
    
    Interestingly, it’s sort of two
    semilattices in the same way that a
    Semiring is two monoids, with laws tying
    them together (distributivity in the case
    of semirings, absorption laws in the case
    of lattices).

    (A, ∨, ∧ )

    Structure:

     ∨  : A × A → A
     ∧  : A × A → A

    Laws:

    (A,  ∨ ) is an idempotent abelian Semigroup
    (A,  ∧ ) is an idempotent abelian Semigroup
    ∀x, y ∈ A; x ∨ (x ∧ y) = x
    ∀x, y ∈ A; x ∧ (x ∨ y) = x

    The last pair of laws is called
    absorption.
    
    Since absorption laws are unique to
    lattices, we discuss them here instead of
    in the glossary.
    
    The absorption laws link a pair of
    semilattices in a kind of distributive
    relationship, so that a Lattice is not
    just any two semilattices that happen to
    be over the same set, but only
    semilattices that are linked in this way.
    
    In particular, the absorption laws ensure
    that the two semilattices are dual of each
    other.
    
    It can take a moment to see what it means,
    so let’s pause and look at concrete
    examples.

    Consider a Boolean Lattice with two
    elements, True and False, where ||
    corresponds to ∨ and && corresponds to ∧:

        λ> False || (False && True)
        False

        λ> False && (False || True)
        False

    But it’s important to note that these hold
    for all x and y in the set. So, if we swap
    them, the absorption laws still hold:

        λ> True || (True && False)
        True

        λ> True && (True || False) 
        True

    Positive integers form a Lattice under the
    operations min and max, and we can see the
    absorption law in action here, too.

        λ> 5 `min` (5 `max` 9)
        5

        λ> 5 `max` (5 `min` 9)
        5

    The absorption laws are sometimes called a
    special case of identity, and they’re also
    related to idempotence in that the
    idempotence laws can be derived from the
    absorption laws taken together.

Bounded lattice
    [Lattice-like structure]

    A Lattice whose Semigroup structures are
    monoids.

    (A, ∨,∧,0, 1)

    Structure:
    ∨ : A × A → A
    ∧ : A × A → A
    0 : A
    1 : A

    Laws:
    (A, ∨, ∧ ) is a Lattice
    (A, ∨,0) is a Monoid
    (A, ∧,1) is a Monoid

Complemented lattice
    [Lattice-like structure]

    A Bounded lattice where each element has a
    complement.

    (A, ∨,∧,0, 1, ′)

    Structure:
    ∨ : A × A → A
    ∧ : A × A → A
    0 : A
    1 : A
    ′ : A → A

    Laws:
    (A, ∨,∧,0, 1) is a Bounded lattice
    ∀x ∈ A; x ∨ x′ = 1
    ∀x ∈ A; x ∧ x′ = 0

    Nota bene:
    
    Although ′ defines a particular choice of
    complements (i.e., each element x ∈ A has
    exactly one corresponding x′ ∈ A), there
    may additionally be other elements y ∈ A
    such that x ∨ y = 1 and x ∧ y = 0.
    
    In particular, there may be other suitable
    ′ functions, and x″ is not necessarily x.

Distributive lattice
    [Lattice-like structure]

    A Lattice where the operations distribute
    over each other.

    Lattice (A, ∨, ∧ )

    Laws:

    ∀x, y, z ∈ A; x ∧ (y ∨ z) = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)
    ∀x, y, z ∈ A; x ∨ (y ∧ z) = (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z)

    Strictly speaking, the second law can be
    derived from the first law and the Lattice
    laws, and as such is redundant.
    
    Every totally ordered set, such as the
    real numbers and subsets of the reals
    including the naturals and integers, form
    distributive lattices with max as ∨ (join)
    and min as ∧ (meet).

Heyting algebra
    [Lattice-like structure]

    A bounded, Distributive lattice with an
    implication operation.

    (A, ∨,∧,0, 1,  ⇒ )

    Structure:
    ∨ : A × A → A
    ∧ : A × A → A
    0 : A
    1 : A
    ⇒ : A × A → A

    Laws:
    (A, ∨,∧,0, 1) is a bounded, Distributive lattice.
    ∀x ∈ A; x ⇒ x = 1
    ∀x, y ∈ A; x ∧ (x ⇒ y) = x ∧ y
    ∀x, y ∈ A; y ∧ (x ⇒ y) = y
    ∀x, y, z ∈ A; x ⇒ (y ∧ z) = (x ⇒ y) ∧ (x ⇒ z)

Boolean algebra
    [Lattice-like structure]

    A complemented Heyting algebra.

    Complemented lattice (A, ∨,∧,0, 1, ′)

    Laws:
    (A, ∨,∧,0, 1,  ⇒ ) is a Heyting algebra
    where  ⇒  : A × A → A by x ⇒ y = x′ ∨ y.

topological group
    [Group]

    A Group G together with a topology on G
    such that both the group's binary
    operation and the function mapping Group
    elements to their respective inverses are
    continuous functions with respect to the
    topology.
    
    A topological group is a mathematical
    object with both an algebraic structure
    and a topological structure.
    
    Thus, one may perform algebraic
    operations, because of the Group
    structure, and one may talk about
    continuous functions, because of the
    topology.
    
    Topological groups, along with continuous
    Group actions, are used to study
    continuous symmetries, which have many
    applications, for example, in physics.

amenable group
    [topological group]

    A locally compact topological group G
    carrying a kind of averaging operation on
    bounded functions that is invariant under
    translation by Group elements.

bijection
bijective function
one-to-one correspondence
invertible function
    A function between the elements of two
    sets, where each element of one set is
    paired with exactly one element of the
    other set, and each element of the other
    set is paired with exactly one element of
    the first set.
