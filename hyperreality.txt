hyperreal
hyperreality
    [#semiotics]
    [#postmodernism]

    An inability of consciousness to
    distinguish reality from a simulation of
    reality, especially in technologically
    advanced postmodern societies.

    Proposed by Jean Baudrillard.

    This is more prominent in technologically
    advanced societies.

    Hyperreality is a state where reality and
    fiction are blended together.
    
    For Baudrillard, the world no longer has a
    chance of escape into an upper realm of
    Truth, God, the Law, or the Idea, but
    merely the lower reaches of immanence.
