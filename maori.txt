wairua 
    spirit, soul - spirit of a person which
    exists beyond death.
    
    It is the non-physical spirit, distinct
    from the body and the mauri.
    
    To some, the wairua resides in the heart
    or mind of someone while others believe it
    is part of the whole person and is not
    located at any particular part of the
    body.
    
    The wairua begins its existence when the
    eyes form in the foetus and is immortal.
    
    While alive a person's wairua can be
    affected by mākutu through karakia.
    
    Tohunga can damage wairua and also protect
    the wairua against harm.
    
    The wairua of a miscarriage or abortion
    can become a type of guardian for the
    family or may be used by tohunga for less
    beneficial purposes.
    
    Some believe that all animate and
    inanimate things have a whakapapa and a
    wairua.
    
    Some believe that atua Māori, or Io-matua-
    kore, can instill wairua into something.
    
    Tohunga, the agents of the atua, are able
    to activate or instil a wairua into
    something, such as a new wharenui, through
    karakia.
    
    During life, the wairua may leave the body
    for brief periods during dreams.
    
    The wairua has the power to warn the
    individual of impending danger through
    visions and dreams.
    
    On death the wairua becomes tapu.
    
    It is believed to remain with or near the
    body and speeches are addressed to the
    person and the wairua of that person
    encouraging it on its way to Te Pō.
    
    Eventually the wairua departs to join
    other wairua in Te Pō, the world of the
    departed spirits, or to Hawaiki, the
    ancestral homeland.
    
    The spirit travels to Te Reinga where it
    descends to Te Pō.
    
    Wairua of the dead that linger on earth
    are called kēhua.
    
    During kawe mate, or hari mate, hura
    kōhatu and other important occasions the
    wairua is summoned to return to the marae.
