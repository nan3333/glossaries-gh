Hosanna
    Save, Please!
        "Please Lord, please save us.

        Please, Lord, please give us success"
        (Psalm 118:25).

        The Hebrew word, "hoshi'a na," is
        translated in Greek as "(h)osanna."

        In English, we known it as "hosanna."

        The original intent of the scripture
        is "Save!"

        It is viewed as a plea for help.

        It's as if we were yelling "stop!"
        at someone about to throw a
        firecracker at us.

        We use this when we understand the
        potential impact of something about to
        happen, and as an act of surrender.

        In moments like this, we realize we
        cannot save ourselves

        and we need to connect to our source
        of security quickly.

        In the firecracker example, that
        security is the person with the
        firecracker in their hand.

        In our spiritual lives though, that
        security is in God.

        In its purest form, this is worship as
        we feel we have to come to the end of
        ourselves and we need God to
        intervene.

    Salvation! Thank You!
        Throughout different translations and
        edits, the original plea to "please,
        save us!" changed to a proclamation of
        "Salvation!  Thank you!"

        We read above in Psalms 118:25,
        "Please, Lord, please save us.
        Please give us success."

        This is the only time this plea is
        used.

        Right after that, in verse 26, there
        is a shift from concern to confidence.

        Verse 26 says, "Blessed is the one who
        comes in the name of the Lord."

        This is a great example of faith and a
        demonstration of the shift from Old
        Testament to New Testament.

        Today, we hear songs like the ones
        described in the opening and read
        scriptures in the New Testament where
        "hosanna" is used more as a term of
        adoration and praise.
