epistemology
    The branch of philosophy concerned with
    knowledge.
    
    Epistemologists study the nature, origin,
    and scope of knowledge, epistemic
    justification, the rationality of belief,
    and various related issues.
    
    Epistemology is considered a major
    subfield of philosophy, along with other
    major subfields such as ethics, logic, and
    metaphysics.

    The theory of knowledge, especially with
    regard to its methods, validity, and
    scope, and the distinction between
    justified belief and opinion.

apperception
    [epistemology]

    The introspective or reflective
    apprehension by the mind of its own inner
    states"

truthmaker theory
    The branch of metaphysics that explores
    the relationships between what is true and
    what exists.
    
    The basic intuition behind truthmaker
    theory is that truth depends on being.
    
    For example, a perceptual experience of a
    green tree may be said to be true because
    there actually is a green tree.

    This is meant to be a modern alternative
    to the "correspondence theory".

reflexivity
    [#epistemology]
    [#sociology of knowledge]
    [social theory]

    Refers to circular relationships between
    cause and effect, especially as embedded
    in human belief structures.

skepticism
scepticism
    Generally a questioning attitude or doubt
    towards one or more putative instances of
    knowledge which are asserted to be mere
    belief or dogma.

deflationary theory of truth
    [#theories of truth]

    A deflationary theory of truth is one of a
    family of theories that all have in common
    the claim that assertions of predicate
    truth of a statement do not attribute a
    property called "truth" to such a
    statement.

verity
    A true principle or belief, especially one
    of fundamental importance.
    "the eternal verities"

    Truth.
    "irrefutable, objective verity"

reflexivity
    [#epistemology]
    [#sociology of knowledge]

    Refers to circular relationships between
    cause and effect, especially as embedded
    in human belief structures.

    Generally refers to the examination of
    one's own beliefs, judgments and practices
    during the research process and how these
    may have influenced the research.

    If positionality refers to what we know
    and believe then reflexivity is about what
    we do with this knowledge.

Commonsense Reasoning

Knowledge Representation and Model Checking technique
    Provides the machinery to perform
    "Commonsense Reasoning".

Timed Automata
    [Knowledge Representation and Model Checking technique]

Event Calculus
    [Knowledge Representation and Model Checking technique]

    [[calibre:An Event Calculus Formalization of Timed Automata]]

    A logic framework that allows the concept
    of time to explicitly appear inside
    formulas, while at the same time avoiding
    to step outside First Order Logic.

fluent
    A time-dependent property

event
    [#Commonsense Reasoning]

timepoints
    [#Commonsense Reasoning]

sensualism
    [#epistemology]

    A doctrine whereby sensations and
    perception are the basic and most
    important form of true cognition.

    It may oppose abstract ideas.

propositional truth
    If a proposition is true, then we say it
    has a truth value of "true"; if a
    proposition is false, its truth value is
    "false".
    
    For example, "Grass is green", and "2 + 5
    = 5" are propositions.
    
    The first proposition has the truth value
    of "true" and the second "false".
