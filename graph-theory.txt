multigraph
    [#mathematics]
    [#graph theory

    A graph which is permitted to have
    multiple edges (also called parallel
    edges), that is, edges that have the same
    end nodes.
    
    Thus two vertices may be connected by more
    than one edge.
    
    When multiple edges connect two nodes,
    these are different edges.

tree
    An undirected graph in which any two
    vertices are connected by exactly one
    path, or equivalently a connected acyclic
    undirected graph.
    
forest
    An undirected graph in which any two
    vertices are connected by at most one
    path, or equivalently an acyclic
    undirected graph, or equivalently a
    disjoint union of trees.

    Underlying undirected graph is a tree.

    Underlying undirected graph is a forest.

adjacency matrix
    A square matrix used to represent a finite
    graph.
    
    The elements of the matrix indicate
    whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or
    not in the graph.

    If a pair of points i,j are adjacent then
    that cell is 1.

    rows & columns represent vertices.

    row sum = degree of the vertex that the
    row represents.
    
    In the special case of a finite simple
    graph, the adjacency matrix is a
    (0,1)-matrix with zeros on its diagonal.

incidence matrix
    One key different from an adjacency
    matrix.

    A matrix that shows the relationship
    between two classes of objects.

    If the first class is X and the second is
    Y, the matrix has one row for each element
    of X and one column for each element of Y.
    
    The entry in row x and column y is 1 if x
    and y are related (called incident in this
    context) and 0 if they are not.
    
    There are variations.
