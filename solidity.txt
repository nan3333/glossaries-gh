    data (its state) that resides at a
    specific address on the Ethereum
    blockchain.

    [function]

    It does not change the state, so it can be
    executed on a single node instead of
    having every node in the blockchain run
    it.

    This kind of function does not generate a
    transaction and does not cost gas.

    [keyword]

    Makes variables accessible from other
    contracts.

        mapping (address => uint) public balances;
