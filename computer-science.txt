Church encoding
    A means of representing data and operators
    in the lambda calculus.
    
    The Church numerals are a representation
    of the natural numbers using lambda
    notation.
    
    The method is named for Alonzo Church, who
    first encoded data in the lambda calculus
    this way.

Scott encoding
    A way to represent (recursive) data types
    in the lambda calculus.
    
    Church encoding performs a similar
    function.
    
    The data and operators form a mathematical
    structure which is embedded in the lambda
    calculus.
    
    Whereas Church encoding starts with
    representations of the basic data types,
    and builds up from it, Scott encoding
    starts from the simplest method to compose
    algebraic data types.
    
Mogensenâ€“Scott encoding
    Extends and slightly modifies Scott
    encoding by applying the encoding to
    Metaprogramming.
    
    This encoding allows the representation of
    lambda calculus terms, as data, to be
    operated on by a meta program.

covariance vs contravariance
    [#computer science]

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)

variance
    [#computer science]

    Refers to how subtyping between more
    complex types relates to subtyping between
    their components.
    
    For example, how should a list of Cats
    relate to a list of Animals? Or how should
    a function that returns Cat relate to a
    function that returns Animal?

contravariant
contravariance
    On the other hand, "function from Animal
    to String" is a subtype of "function from
    Cat to String" because the function type
    constructor is contravariant in the
    parameter type.
    
    Here the subtyping relation of the simple
    types is reversed for the complex types.

universally unique identifier
UUID
    A 128-bit number used to identify
    information in computer systems.
    
    The term globally unique identifier (GUID)
    is also used, typically in software
    created by Microsoft.
    
    When generated according to the standard
    methods, UUIDs are, for practical
    purposes, unique.
    
    Their uniqueness does not depend on a
    central registration authority or
    coordination between the parties
    generating them, unlike most other
    numbering schemes.
    
    While the probability that a UUID will be
    duplicated is not zero, it is close enough
    to zero to be negligible.

Solution architecture
    A practice of defining and describing an
    architecture of a system delivered in
    context of a specific solution and as such
    it may encompass description of an entire
    system or only its specific parts.

    Definition of a solution architecture is
    typically led by a solution architect. 

mutual recursion
    Two functions are called mutually
    recursive if the first function makes a
    recursive call to the second function and
    the second function, in turn, calls the
    first one.

marshalling
marshaling
    The process of transforming the memory
    representation of an object to a data
    format suitable for storage or
    transmission, and it is typically used
    when data must be moved between different
    parts of a computer program or from one
    program to another

Software Transactional Memory
STM
    A concurrency control mechanism analogous
    to database transactions for controlling
    access to shared memory in concurrent
    computing.
    
    It is an alternative to lock-based
    synchronization.
    
    STM is a strategy implemented in software,
    rather than as a hardware component.
    
    A transaction in this context occurs when
    a piece of code executes a series of reads
    and writes to shared memory.
    
    These reads and writes logically occur at
    a single instant in time; intermediate
    states are not visible to other
    (successful) transactions.

data validation
    The process of ensuring data have
    undergone data cleansing to ensure they
    have data quality, that is, that they are
    both correct and useful.

program analysis
    The process of automatically analyzing the
    behavior of computer programs regarding a
    property such as correctness, robustness,
    safety and liveness.
    
    Program analysis focuses on two major
    areas:
    - program optimization, and
    - program correctness.

halting problem
    [#computability theory]

    The primary obstacle preventing the
    bridging of expressiveness and
    performance.

    The problem of determining, from a
    description of an arbitrary computer
    program and an input, whether the program
    will finish running, or continue to run
    forever.

c
    Ultimately, C is a competing style more
    than it is a competing language.
    
    It is something
    
    other higher level languages regress to
    once they start worrying about
    performance.

skew heap
self-adjusting heap
    [heap]

    A heap data structure implemented as a
    binary tree.
    
    Advantageous because of their ability to
    merge more quickly than binary heaps.
    
    In contrast with binary heaps, there are
    no structural constraints, so there is no
    guarantee that the height of the tree is
    logarithmic.
    
    Only two conditions must be satisfied:
    - The general heap order must be enforced.
    - Every operation (add, remove_min, merge)
      on two skew heaps must be done using a
      special skew heap merge.

top-k filtering
    Only keep/deliver to the cream of the crop, the top-k.

    Example:
    - Keep tokens with highest probability.
    - Deliver only to the k best ranked
      subscribers.

Polling
    The process where the computer or
    controlling device waits for an external
    device to check for its readiness or
    state, often with low-level hardware.
    
    For example, when a printer is connected
    via a parallel port, the computer waits
    until the printer has received the next
    character.

interrupt
    The device notifies the CPU that it needs
    servicing whereas, in polling CPU
    repeatedly checks whether a device needs
    servicing.
    
    Interrupt is a hardware mechanism as CPU
    has a wire, interrupt-request line which
    signal that interrupt has occurred.

separation of concerns
    A design principle for separating a
    computer program into distinct sections
    such that each section addresses a
    separate concern.

palindrome
    A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the
    same backward as forward, e.g., madam or
    nurses run.
