Timaeus
    One of Plato's dialogues, mostly in the
    form of a long monologue given by the
    title character Timaeus of Locri, written
    c. 360 BC.
    
    The work puts forward speculation on the
    nature of the physical world and human
    beings and is followed by the dialogue
    Critias.

Platonism
    The philosophy of Plato and philosophical
    systems closely derived from it, though
    contemporary platonists do not necessarily
    accept all of the doctrines of Plato.
    
    Platonism had a profound effect on Western
    thought.
    
    Platonism at least affirms the existence
    of abstract objects, which are asserted to
    exist in a third realm distinct from both
    the sensible external world and from the
    internal world of consciousness, and is
    the opposite of nominalism.
    
    This can apply to properties, types,
    propositions, meanings, numbers, sets,
    truth values, and so on (see abstract
    object theory).
    
    Philosophers who affirm the existence of
    abstract objects are sometimes called
    platonists; those who deny their existence
    are sometimes called nominalists.
    
    The terms "platonism" and "nominalism"
    also have established senses in the
    history of philosophy.
    
    They denote positions that have little to
    do with the modern notion of an abstract
    object.
    
    In a narrower sense, the term might
    indicate the doctrine of Platonic realism,
    a form of mysticism.
    
    The central concept of Platonism, a
    distinction essential to the Theory of
    Forms, is the distinction between the
    reality which is perceptible but
    unintelligible, associated with the flux
    of Heraclitus and studied by the likes of
    science, and the reality which is
    imperceptible but intelligible, associated
    with the unchanging being of Parmenides
    and studied by the likes of mathematics.
    
    Geometry was the main motivation of Plato,
    and this also shows the influence of
    Pythagoras.
    
    The Forms are typically described in
    dialogues such as the Phaedo, Symposium
    and Republic as perfect archetypes of
    which objects in the everyday world are
    imperfect copies.
    
    Aristotle's Third Man Argument is its most
    famous criticism in antiquity.

    Attributed to Plato, that the physical
    world is not as real or true as timeless,
    absolute, unchangeable ideas.
