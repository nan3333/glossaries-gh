philosophy
    Intentionality is the power of minds and
    mental states to be about, to represent,
    or to stand for, things, properties and
    states of affairs.
    
    To say of an individual’s mental states
    that they have intentionality is to say
    that they are mental representations or
    that they have contents.
    
    Furthermore, to the extent that a speaker
    utters words from some NL or draws
    pictures or symbols from a formal language
    for the purpose of conveying to others the
    contents of her mental states, these
    artifacts used by a speaker too have
    contents or intentionality.
    
    ‘Intentionality’ is a philosopher’s word:
    ever since it was introduced into
    philosophy by Franz Brentano in the last
    quarter of the nineteenth century, it has
    been used to refer to the puzzles of
    representation, all of which lie at the
    interface between the philosophy of mind
    and the philosophy of language.
    
    A picture of a dog, a proper name (e.g.,
    ‘Fido’), the common noun ‘dog’ or the
    concept expressed by the word can mean,
    represent, or stand for, one or several
    hairy barking creatures.
    
    A complete thought, a full sentence or a
    picture can stand for or describe a state
    of affairs

supertask
    A countably infinite sequence of
    operations that occur sequentially within
    a finite interval of time.
    
    The term supertask was coined by the
    philosopher James F. Thomson, who devised
    Thomson's lamp.
    
    The term hypertask derives from Clark and
    Read in their paper of that name.

hypertask
    Supertasks are called "hypertasks" when
    the number of operations becomes
    uncountably infinite.
    
ultratask
    A hypertask that includes one task for
    each ordinal number is called an
    "ultratask".
    
interpellate
    (of an ideology or discourse) bring into
    being or give identity to (an individual
    or category).

infinite regress
    An infinite series of entities governed by
    a recursive principle that determines how
    each entity in the series depends on or is
    produced by its predecessor.
    
    In the epistemic regress, for example, a
    belief is justified because it is based on
    another belief that is justified.

René Girard
René Noël Théophile Girard
    [French historian]
    [philosopher]

    A French polymath, historian, literary
    critic, and philosopher of social science
    whose work belongs to the tradition of
    anthropological philosophy.
    
    Girard was the author of nearly thirty
    books, with his writings spanning many
    academic domains

Irrealism
    [#Philosophy]

    Irrealism is a philosophical position
    first advanced by Nelson Goodman in "Ways
    of Worldmaking", encompassing
    epistemology, metaphysics, and aesthetics.

consequentialism
    The doctrine that the morality of an
    action is to be judged solely by its
    consequences.

nihilism
    The belief that all values are baseless
    and that nothing can be known or
    communicated.
    
    It is often associated with extreme
    pessimism and a radical skepticism that
    condemns existence.
    
    A true nihilist would believe in nothing,
    have no loyalties, and no purpose other
    than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.

realism
Philosophical realism
    Usually not treated as a position of its
    own but as a stance towards other subject
    matters.
    
    Realism about a certain kind of thing is
    the thesis that this kind of thing has
    mind-independent existence, i.e. that it
    is not just a mere appearance in the eye
    of the beholder.

nominalism
    The doctrine that universals or general
    ideas are mere names without any
    corresponding reality.
    
    Only particular objects exist, and
    properties, numbers, and sets are merely
    features of the way of considering the
    things that exist.
    
    Important in medieval scholastic thought,
    nominalism is associated particularly with
    William of Occam.

Axiology
    The philosophical study of value.
    
    It is either the collective term for
    ethics and aesthetics, philosophical
    fields that depend crucially on notions of
    worth, or the foundation for these fields,
    and thus similar to value theory and meta-
    ethics.

Ontology
    The branch of philosophy that studies
    concepts such as existence, being,
    becoming, and reality.
    
    It includes the questions of how entities
    are grouped into basic categories and
    which of these entities exist on the most
    fundamental level.

Epistemology
    The branch of philosophy concerned with
    knowledge.
    
    Epistemologists study the nature of
    knowledge, epistemic justification, the
    rationality of belief, and various related
    issues.
    
    Epistemology is considered one of the four
    main branches of philosophy, along with
    ethics, logic, and metaphysics.

Polanyi's Paradox
    [theory]

    We can know more than we can tell.
    
    Human knowledge of how the world functions
    and capability are, to a large extent,
    beyond our explicit understanding.

    Explains the cognitive phenomenon that
    there exist many tasks which we, human
    beings, understand intuitively how to
    perform but cannot verbalize the rules or
    procedures behind it.
    
    This "self-ignorance" is common to many
    human activities, from driving a car in
    traffic to face recognition.
    
    Humans are relying on their tacit
    knowledge, which is difficult to
    adequately express by verbal means, when
    engaging these tasks.
    
    Has been widely considered a major
    obstacle in the fields of AI and
    automation, since the absence of
    consciously accessible knowledge creates
    tremendous difficulty in programming.
    
    Overcomed by recent advances in ML, some
    technological optimists argue.
    
    Instead of relaying on programmer’s
    algorithms to instruct them in human
    knowledge, computer systems are now able
    to learn tacit rules from context,
    abundant data, and applied statistics on
    their own.
    
    Since machines can infer the tacit
    knowledge that human beings draw upon from
    examples without human assistance, they
    are no longer limited by those rules
    tacitly applied but not explicitly
    understood by humans.
