postulation
    A suggestion or assumption of the
    existence, fact, or truth of something as
    a basis for reasoning, discussion, or
    belief.
    "discrepancies between empirical findings
    and theoretical postulations"

    (in ecclesiastical law) a nomination or
    election of someone to an ecclesiastical
    office subject to the sanction of a higher
    authority.

egalitarian
qualitarianism
    A school of thought within political
    philosophy that builds from the concept of
    social equality, prioritizing it for all
    people.
    
    Egalitarian doctrines are generally
    characterized by the idea that all humans
    are equal in fundamental worth or moral
    status.

historicity
    [philosophy]

    The idea or fact that something has a
    historical origin and developed through
    history: concepts, practices, values.
    
    This is opposed to the belief that the
    same thing, in particular normative
    institutions or correlated ideologies, is
    natural or essential and thus exists
    universally.

metamodernism
    A broad range of developments in culture
    and society that appear after and gesture
    beyond postmodernism, and at the same time
    attempt to characterize post-
    postmodernism.

    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0caFRFoms][What is Metamodernism? - YouTube]]

    What's metamodern are aesthetic mannerisms
    that protect interiority against the self-
    doubt that potentially comes with multi-
    perspectivalism.
    
    An uncomplicated embrace of positivity:
    The postmodern sensibility often made it
    embarrassing to express positive emotions,
    such as hope, enthusiasm, glee, and so on.

rudiment
    The first principles of (a subject).
    "she taught the girls the rudiments of
    reading and writing"

mimetic
    The word is Greek and means “imitation”
    (though in the sense of “re-presentation”
    rather than of “copying”).

    Plato and Aristotle spoke of mimesis as
    the re-presentation of nature.

    Relating to, constituting, or habitually
    practising mimesis.
    "mimetic patterns in butterflies"

philosophize
philosophising
    Speculate or theorize about fundamental or
    serious issues, especially in a tedious or
    pompous way.
    "he paused for a while to philosophize on
    racial equality"

    Explain or argue (an idea) in terms of
    one's philosophical theories.
    "Marx himself did not philosophize the
    issue"

reductionism
    Any of several related philosophical ideas
    regarding the associations between
    phenomena, which can be described in terms
    of other simpler or more fundamental
    phenomena.
    
    It is also described as an intellectual
    and philosophical position that interprets
    a complex system as the sum of its parts.

body without organs
    To "make oneself a body without organs,"
    then, is to actively experiment with
    oneself to draw out and activate these
    virtual potentials.
    
    These potentials are mostly activated (or
    "actualized") through conjunctions with
    other bodies (or BwOs) that Deleuze calls
    "becomings".

the schizophrenic
    A zero-intensity body without organs
    (BwO); whereas the schizo's body is a
    surface on which to record the flows of
    desire.

teleological argument
physico-theological argument
argument from design
intelligent design argument
    An argument for the existence of God or,
    more generally, that complex functionality
    in the natural world which looks designed
    is evidence of an intelligent creator.

Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies
    A 1989 book by United States academic Noam
    Chomsky concerning political power using
    propaganda to distort and distract from
    major issues to maintain confusion and
    complicity, preventing real democracy from
    becoming effective.

The Homeric Question
    Concerns the doubts and consequent debate
    over the identity of Homer, the authorship
    of the Iliad and Odyssey, and their
    historicity (especially concerning the
    Iliad).

    Every civilization has expressed its views
    on language; one could even say that
    language is something of a “Homeric
    question” for humanity: a question
    indirectly reflecting the pillars
    supporting that culture.

panpsychism
    [philosophy of mind]

    The view that mind or a mindlike aspect is
    a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of
    reality.
    
    It is also described as a theory that "the
    mind is a fundamental feature of the world
    which exists throughout the universe."

John Locke
    Holds that personal identity is a matter
    of psychological continuity.
    
    He considered personal identity (or the
    self) to be founded on consciousness (viz.
    memory), and not on the substance of
    either the soul or the body.

Empiricism
    A theory that states that knowledge comes
    only or primarily from sensory experience.
    
    It is one of several views of
    epistemology, along with rationalism and
    skepticism.
    
    Empiricism emphasizes the role of
    empirical evidence in the formation of
    ideas, rather than innate ideas or
    traditions.

nativist
Nativism
    A person who advocates the theory that
    concepts, mental capacities, and mental
    structures are innate rather than acquired
    by learning.
    "extreme views were put forward by
    nativists on the one hand and by
    empiricists on the other"

Materialism
    A form of philosophical monism that holds
    that matter is the fundamental substance
    in nature, and that all things, including
    mental states and consciousness, are
    results of material interactions.

secondness
brute secondness
    A fundamental category in Peircean
    philosophy comprising actual facts and
    expressive of necessity, force, and
    determination — compare firstness,
    thirdness.

philosophy
    Intentionality is the power of minds and
    mental states to be about, to represent,
    or to stand for, things, properties and
    states of affairs.
    
    To say of an individual’s mental states
    that they have intentionality is to say
    that they are mental representations or
    that they have contents.
    
    Furthermore, to the extent that a speaker
    utters words from some NL or draws
    pictures or symbols from a formal language
    for the purpose of conveying to others the
    contents of her mental states, these
    artifacts used by a speaker too have
    contents or intentionality.
    
    ‘Intentionality’ is a philosopher’s word:
    ever since it was introduced into
    philosophy by Franz Brentano in the last
    quarter of the nineteenth century, it has
    been used to refer to the puzzles of
    representation, all of which lie at the
    interface between the philosophy of mind
    and the philosophy of language.
    
    A picture of a dog, a proper name (e.g.,
    ‘Fido’), the common noun ‘dog’ or the
    concept expressed by the word can mean,
    represent, or stand for, one or several
    hairy barking creatures.
    
    A complete thought, a full sentence or a
    picture can stand for or describe a state
    of affairs

supertask
    A countably infinite sequence of
    operations that occur sequentially within
    a finite interval of time.
    
    The term supertask was coined by the
    philosopher James F. Thomson, who devised
    Thomson's lamp.
    
    The term hypertask derives from Clark and
    Read in their paper of that name.

hypertask
    Supertasks are called "hypertasks" when
    the number of operations becomes
    uncountably infinite.
    
ultratask
    A hypertask that includes one task for
    each ordinal number is called an
    "ultratask".
    
interpellate
    (of an ideology or discourse) bring into
    being or give identity to (an individual
    or category).

infinite regress
    An infinite series of entities governed by
    a recursive principle that determines how
    each entity in the series depends on or is
    produced by its predecessor.
    
    In the epistemic regress, for example, a
    belief is justified because it is based on
    another belief that is justified.

René Girard
René Noël Théophile Girard
    [French historian]
    [philosopher]

    A French polymath, historian, literary
    critic, and philosopher of social science
    whose work belongs to the tradition of
    anthropological philosophy.
    
    Girard was the author of nearly thirty
    books, with his writings spanning many
    academic domains

Irrealism
    [#Philosophy]

    Irrealism is a philosophical position
    first advanced by Nelson Goodman in "Ways
    of Worldmaking", encompassing
    epistemology, metaphysics, and aesthetics.

consequentialism
    The doctrine that the morality of an
    action is to be judged solely by its
    consequences.

nihilism
    The belief that all values are baseless
    and that nothing can be known or
    communicated.
    
    It is often associated with extreme
    pessimism and a radical skepticism that
    condemns existence.
    
    A true nihilist would believe in nothing,
    have no loyalties, and no purpose other
    than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.

realism
Philosophical realism
    Usually not treated as a position of its
    own but as a stance towards other subject
    matters.
    
    Realism about a certain kind of thing is
    the thesis that this kind of thing has
    mind-independent existence, i.e. that it
    is not just a mere appearance in the eye
    of the beholder.

nominalism
    The doctrine that universals or general
    ideas are mere names without any
    corresponding reality.
    
    Only particular objects exist, and
    properties, numbers, and sets are merely
    features of the way of considering the
    things that exist.
    
    Important in medieval scholastic thought,
    nominalism is associated particularly with
    William of Occam.

Axiology
    The philosophical study of value.
    
    It is either the collective term for
    ethics and aesthetics, philosophical
    fields that depend crucially on notions of
    worth, or the foundation for these fields,
    and thus similar to value theory and meta-
    ethics.

Ontology
    The branch of philosophy that studies
    concepts such as existence, being,
    becoming, and reality.
    
    It includes the questions of how entities
    are grouped into basic categories and
    which of these entities exist on the most
    fundamental level.

Epistemology
    The branch of philosophy concerned with
    knowledge.
    
    Epistemologists study the nature of
    knowledge, epistemic justification, the
    rationality of belief, and various related
    issues.
    
    Epistemology is considered one of the four
    main branches of philosophy, along with
    ethics, logic, and metaphysics.

Polanyi's Paradox
    [theory]

    We can know more than we can tell.
    
    Human knowledge of how the world functions
    and capability are, to a large extent,
    beyond our explicit understanding.

    Explains the cognitive phenomenon that
    there exist many tasks which we, human
    beings, understand intuitively how to
    perform but cannot verbalize the rules or
    procedures behind it.
    
    This "self-ignorance" is common to many
    human activities, from driving a car in
    traffic to face recognition.
    
    Humans are relying on their tacit
    knowledge, which is difficult to
    adequately express by verbal means, when
    engaging these tasks.
    
    Has been widely considered a major
    obstacle in the fields of AI and
    automation, since the absence of
    consciously accessible knowledge creates
    tremendous difficulty in programming.
    
    Overcomed by recent advances in ML, some
    technological optimists argue.
    
    Instead of relaying on programmer’s
    algorithms to instruct them in human
    knowledge, computer systems are now able
    to learn tacit rules from context,
    abundant data, and applied statistics on
    their own.
    
    Since machines can infer the tacit
    knowledge that human beings draw upon from
    examples without human assistance, they
    are no longer limited by those rules
    tacitly applied but not explicitly
    understood by humans.

David Chalmers
    An Australian philosopher and cognitive
    scientist specializing in the areas of
    philosophy of mind and philosophy of
    language.
    
    He is a Professor of Philosophy and Neural
    Science at New York University, as well as
    co-director of NYU's Center for Mind,
    Brain and Consciousness.

intelligibility
    What can be comprehended by the human mind
    in contrast to sense perception.
    
    The intelligible method is thought
    thinking itself, or the human mind
    reflecting on itself.

state of affairs
situation
    [#philosophy]

    In philosophy, a state of affairs, also
    known as a situation, is a way the actual
    world must be in order to make some given
    proposition about the actual world true;
    in other words, a state of affairs is a
    truth-maker, whereas a proposition is a
    truth-bearer.

precession of simulacra
    The postmodern phenomenon wherein "images
    precede reality"-accurately describes what
    is wrong with the pre-abortion ultrasound
    mandates that have recently been enacted
    in a number of states.

orders of simulacra
    Baudrillard's orders of simulacra exist as
    follows:
    - The first order of simulacra focuses on
      counterfeits and false images.
    - The second order of simulacra is
      dominated by production of these false
      images.
    - The third order of simulacra rests on
      ultimate simulation.
