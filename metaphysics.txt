abstract
concrete
    [#metaphysics]

    The distinction between abstract and
    concrete refers to a divide between two
    types of entities.
    
    Many philosophers hold that this
    difference has fundamental metaphysical
    significance.

noetic
    Relating to mental activity or the
    intellect.
    "the noetic quality of a mystical
    experience refers to the sense of
    revelation"

metaphysics
    The branch of philosophy that examines the
    fundamental nature of reality, including
    the relationship between mind and matter,
    between substance and attribute, and
    between potentiality and actuality.

Cybernetic Culture Research Unit
CCRU
    Was an experimental cultural theorist
    collective based out of Warwick
    University, England, from 1995 to 1997,
    and later as a student run collective
    after 2003.
    
    Warwick University maintains that the CCRU
    was never a sanctioned academic project,
    with some faculty going so far as to
    assert that the CCRU "has never existed".

hyperstition
    A term coined in the 1990s to describe
    fictions that make themselves true. As the
    CCRU once defined it: â€œThere is no
    difference in principle between a
    universe, a religion, and a hoax.

Ship of Theseus
    [metaphysics of identity]
    
    The ship of Theseus is a thought
    experiment that raises the question of
    whether an object that has had all of its
    components replaced remains fundamentally
    the same object.

loom
    A symbol of cosmic creation and the
    structure upon which individual destiny is
    woven.
    
    This symbolism is encapsulated in the
    classical myth of Arachne who was changed
    into a spider by the goddess Athena, who
    was jealous of her skill at the godlike
    craft of weaving.
    
    In Maya civilization the goddess Ixchel
    taught the first woman how to weave at the
    beginning of time.

quintessence
    1: the fifth and highest element in
    ancient and medieval philosophy that
    permeates all nature and is the substance
    composing the celestial bodies

    2: the essence of a thing in its purest
    and most concentrated form

    3: the most typical example or
    representative

essence
    A polysemic term, used in philosophy and
    theology as a designation for the property
    or set of properties that make an entity
    or substance what it fundamentally is, and
    which it has by necessity, and without
    which it loses its identity.
