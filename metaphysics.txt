Cybernetic Culture Research Unit
CCRU
    Was an experimental cultural theorist
    collective based out of Warwick
    University, England, from 1995 to 1997,
    and later as a student run collective
    after 2003.
    
    Warwick University maintains that the CCRU
    was never a sanctioned academic project,
    with some faculty going so far as to
    assert that the CCRU "has never existed".

loom
    A symbol of cosmic creation and the
    structure upon which individual destiny is
    woven.
    
    This symbolism is encapsulated in the
    classical myth of Arachne who was changed
    into a spider by the goddess Athena, who
    was jealous of her skill at the godlike
    craft of weaving.
    
    In Maya civilization the goddess Ixchel
    taught the first woman how to weave at the
    beginning of time.

essence
    A polysemic term, used in philosophy and

    which it loses its identity.
