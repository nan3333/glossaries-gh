many body quantum mechanics
many-body theory
many-body problem
many-body physics
    An area of physics which provides the
    framework for understanding the collective
    behavior of large numbers of interacting
    particles, often on the order of
    Avogadro's number.

    Deals with effects that manifest
    themselves only in systems containing
    large numbers of constituents.

    While the underlying physical laws that
    govern the motion of each individual
    particle may (or may not) be simple, the
    study of the collection of particles can
    be extremely complex.

    In some cases emergent phenomena may arise
    which bear little resemblance to the
    underlying elementary laws.

    Many-body theory plays a central role in
    condensed matter physics.

Schrödinger equation
    A linear partial differential equation
    that describes the wave function or state
    function of a quantum-mechanical system.
    It is a key result in quantum mechanics,
    and its discovery was a significant
    landmark in the development of the
    subject.

    Describes how the state of a system
    evolves.
