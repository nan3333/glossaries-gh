    A tale told in folklore, to warn its

    introduced in a large variety of ways.

    First, a taboo or prohibition is stated:
    some act, location, or thing is said to be
    dangerous.

    Then, the narrative itself is told:
    someone disregarded the warning and
    performed the forbidden act.
