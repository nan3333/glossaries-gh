transfinite numbers
    [#mathematics]

    Numbers that are "infinite" in the sense
    that they are larger than all finite
    numbers, yet not necessarily absolutely
    infinite.
    
    These include the transfinite cardinals,
    which are cardinal numbers used to
    quantify the size of infinite sets, and
    the transfinite ordinals, which are
    ordinal numbers used to provide an
    ordering of infinite sets.
    
    The term transfinite was coined by Georg
    Cantor in 1895, who wished to avoid some
    of the implications of the word infinite
    in connection with these objects, which
    were, nevertheless, not finite.[citation
    needed] Few contemporary writers share
    these qualms; it is now accepted usage to
    refer to transfinite cardinals and
    ordinals as "infinite".
    
    Nevertheless, the term "transfinite" also
    remains in use.
