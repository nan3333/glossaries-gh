    [ranking factor]
    
    The more unique queries we can gather for
    a page, the better our model for the page
    will be.
    
    Our use of Human Web also enables us to
    collect anonymous statistics on the page,
    a part of which is shown below.
    
    This structure shows the popularity of the
    page in different countries at this moment
    in time, which is used as a popularity
    signal.
    
    We can see that it is very popular in the
    UK, less so is Australia, etc.
