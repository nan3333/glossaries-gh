dialectic
dialectics
dialectical method
    A discourse between two or more people
    holding different points of view about a
    subject but wishing to establish the truth
    through reasoned argumentation.

alethiology
    Means the study of truth, but can more
    accurately be translated as the study of
    the nature of truth.

major theories of truth
    - substantive
      - consensus

substantive
    Having a firm basis in reality and so
    important, meaningful, or considerable.
    "there is no substantive evidence for the
    efficacy of these drugs"

    Having a separate and independent
    existence.

correspondence
correspondence theories of truth
    Emphasize that true beliefs and true
    statements correspond to the actual state
    of affairs.
    
    This type of theory stresses a
    relationship between thoughts or
    statements on one hand, and things or
    objects on the other.
    
    It is a traditional model tracing its
    origins to ancient Greek philosophers such
    as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
    
    This class of theories holds that the
    truth or the falsity of a representation
    is determined in principle entirely by how
    it relates to "things" by whether it
    accurately describes those "things".

coherence
coherence theory of truth
    For coherence theories in general, truth
    requires a proper fit of elements within a
    whole system.
    
    Very often, though, coherence is taken to
    imply something more than simple logical
    consistency; often there is a demand that
    the propositions in a coherent system lend
    mutual inferential support to each other.
    
    So, for example, the completeness and
    comprehensiveness of the underlying set of
    concepts is a critical factor in judging
    the validity and usefulness of a coherent
    system.
    
    A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is
    the idea that truth is primarily a
    property of whole systems of propositions,
    and can be ascribed to individual
    propositions only according to their
    coherence with the whole.
    
    Among the assortment of perspectives
    commonly regarded as coherence theory,
    theorists differ on the question of
    whether coherence entails many possible
    true systems of thought or only a single
    absolute system.
    
    Some variants of coherence theory are
    claimed to describe the essential and
    intrinsic properties of formal systems in
    logic and mathematics.

pragmatic
pragmatic theory of truth
    The three most influential forms of the
    pragmatic theory of truth were introduced
    around the turn of the 20th century by
    Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and
    John Dewey.
    
    Although there are wide differences in
    viewpoint among these and other proponents
    of pragmatic theory, they hold in common
    that truth is verified and confirmed by
    the results of putting one's concepts into
    practice.
    
    Peirce defines truth as follows:
        Truth is that concordance of an
        abstract statement with the ideal
        limit towards which endless
        investigation would tend to bring
        scientific belief, which concordance
        the abstract statement may possess by
        virtue of the confession of its
        inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this
        confession is an essential ingredient
        of truth.

constructivist
social constructivism
    Holds that truth is constructed by social
    processes, is historically and culturally
    specific, and that it is in part shaped
    through the power struggles within a
    community.
    
    Constructivism views all of our knowledge
    as "constructed," because it does not
    reflect any external "transcendent"
    realities (as a pure correspondence theory
    might hold).
    
    Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as
    contingent on convention, human
    perception, and social experience.
    
    It is believed by constructivists that
    representations of physical and biological
    reality, including race, sexuality, and
    gender, are socially constructed.

consensus
consensus theory of truth
    Consensus theory holds that truth is
    whatever is agreed upon, or in some
    versions, might come to be agreed upon, by
    some specified group.
    
    Such a group might include all human
    beings, or a subset thereof consisting of
    more than one person.
    
    Among the current advocates of consensus
    theory as a useful accounting of the
    concept of "truth" is the philosopher
    JÃ¼rgen Habermas.
    
    Habermas maintains that truth is what
    would be agreed upon in an ideal speech
    situation.
    
    Among the current strong critics of
    consensus theory is the philosopher
    Nicholas Rescher.
