Perlocutionary Protocol
PP

Semiosis Protocol
SP
    You pay for semiosis.

    A cryptocurrency for prompting stewardship
    that rewards intelligibility, deglobalises
    and slows the growth of large language
    models by reusing outputs, and protects
    local truth by anonymising inputs.

    By slowing the growth of large LMs and
    protecting input data to prompt functions,
    local communities and individuals are
    protect from coercion.

    Communities are free to use their own
    languages, whilst still being able to
    communicate via the protocol and thus put
    a price on illocutionary force in either
    direction. Thus people may be fairly
    persuaded instead of through force, and
    also may have illocutionary influence but
    at a price they are willing to pay. It
    puts market forces to work to more fairly
    distribute language power.

AGI
    Centralized language power.

Semiotic NFT
sNFT
snft
࿋
    [iNFT]
    [functor]

    It's a functor because it's meant to be
    called as a function, but has particular
    side-effects.

    Contains
    - sign function
    - price function
    - reward function

gas
    Earn it by:
    - hosting/caching payload media.
    - hosting/caching output media.

sign function
s(࿋)
    Parameters:
    - prompt
      - Soft prompts will not be rewarded
        easily because they are
        unintelligible and people will
        naturally distrust them.
    - payloads
      - A list of payload (URL source, hash)
        2-tuples
        - SP must expend gas to obtain these
          payloads. A prompt may fail if the
          function does not have sufficient
          funds to make the transaction,
          including what has been allocated
          for obtaining payloads.
    - vendor
    - p(࿋)
    - id (worldcoin?)
      - needed for the price function to
        regulate users depending on their
        type or role, perhaps.

price function
p(࿋)
    Parameters:
    - base price
    - id (worldcoin?)

    The base may scale with the user type.
    - For example,
      - Maybe best to be less expensive for
        humans to run.
      - Maybe best to be more expensive for
        AIs to run.
      - In some cases, AI is better suited to
        run particular prompts.
        - For example, sensitive statistics.
    - Anyway, a user may be more or less
      entitled to run a type of prompt.
      - But everyone can see this function in
        the iNFT and can decide if it's a good
        idea, and to promote it / incorporate
        it.

reward function
r(࿋)
    Who gets paid (in percentages) when this
    sNFT is run.

    A list of (%, wallet / uid)
     
    Donate to:
    - Use ID iNFTs to identify people by name.
    - charities, for example.
