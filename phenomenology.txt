bracketing
    The preliminary step in the philosophical
    movement of phenomenology describing an
    act of suspending judgment about the
    natural world to instead focus on analysis
    of experience.

phenomenology
    A philosophy of experience.
    
    For phenomenology the ultimate source of
    all meaning and value is the lived
    experience of human beings.
    
    All philosophical systems, scientific
    theories, or aesthetic judgments have the
    status of abstractions from the ebb and
    flow of the lived world.

phenomenological intuition

descriptive phenomenology
descriptive phenomenological method
    [method]

    A powerful way to understand subjective
    experience and to gain insights around
    people's actions and motivations, cutting
    through long-held assumptions and
    challenging conventional wisdom.
    
    It may contribute to the development of
    new theories, changes in policies, or
    changes in responses.

    phenomenological intuition

    Involves neither deduction nor induction
    in order to find meaning, but instead asks
    the researcher to intuit what is essential
    to the phenomenon being studied.
    
    Intuition, in this sense (going along with
    the philosophy of phenomenology), simply
    means that an object (or state of affairs,
    structural whole, proposition etc.)
    becomes presented to consciousness in a
    certain mode of giveness.
    
    In the context of this research method,
    therefore, intuition is used in order to
    get a sense of the lived meaning of each
    description so as to relate them to what
    is known about the phenomenon of interest
    in general These types of generalities are
    not statistical probabilities nor
    universally posited, but are dependent
    upon the lived meaning of the descriptions
    and the meaning of the phenomenon being
    studied.

phenomenological reduction
    The meditative practice described by
    Edmund Husserl, the founder of
    phenomenology, whereby one, as a
    phenomenologist, is able to liberate
    oneself from the captivation in which one
    is held by all that one accepts as being
    the case.

    Three basic stages in phenomenological
    reduction:
    1. the epoche,
    2. the eidetic reduction, and
    3. the transcendental reduction.

    The epoche stage consists of setting aside
    (bracketing) all the beliefs, theories,
    and attitudes about oneself and the world
    which have so far been taken for granted.

    Thus the belief in an independently
    existing world of objects and qualities is
    set aside; the laws of logic, mathematics,
    and sciences, norms and values are all
    brought into question and put aside.
    
    Phenomenology, according to Husserl, must
    be a rigorous science; it must also be
    presuppositionless, in the sense that it
    must attain absolutely valid knowledge of
    things.

    All nonphilosophical sciences are based on
    various kinds of presuppositions which
    cannot be validated within those sciences
    themselves.
