    to enhance their semantic search
    capabilities, which has the potential to
    save lawyers hundreds of hours in
    research.

Algolia
    [#semantic search]
    [#openai-api]

    Offers highly relevant, fast search to
    everyone with a website, mobile app, or
    voice app.
    
    Combining OpenAI’s API with Algolia’s
    advanced search technology allows
    Algolia’s customers to provide their
    customers with NL semantic search, so they
    can better understand questions and
    connect searchers with results that are
    both relevant and fast.
    
    OpenAI helps Algolia answer more complex
    queries than ever before, trimming down
    the prediction time to around 100ms.
    
    This keeps Algolia from having to do a lot
    of work to cache and serve answers to its
    customers.
    
    With OpenAI, Algolia was able to answer
    complex NL questions accurately 4x as
    often as it was using BERT.

    The API can generate complex and
    consistent NL, and enables use cases like
    creative writing.

AI Dungeon
    [#openai-api]
    [#nlg]
    [#nlp]

    An AI-powered text adventure where every
    response is determined by an AI LM.
    
    Typically, for these types of games, the
    developer must preprogram a decision tree
    and text options for the user to select
    from.
    
    AI Dungeon is the first of its kind in
    which any story option is possible, and
    the AI adapts the adventure to the users’
    input.
    
    The game sees 20-25,000 daily users.
    
    Initially built on GPT-2, after moving to
    OpenAI’s new technology accessible through
    the API, AI Dungeon has seen a significant
    increase in user engagement and
    subscriptions.
    
    Users have reported positively on the
    speed and quality of conversations, and
    subscriptions for the game have increased
    nearly 25%.
    
    AI Dungeon hopes to expand AI’s use in
    gaming to make for richer experiences
    during gameplay (particularly with non-
    playable characters (NPCs)).

Art of Problem Solving
AoPS
    [#openai-api]
    [#education]
    [#nlp]

    Helping to effectively prepare the next
    generation of STEM professionals through
    engaging online instruction, at a time
    when the traditional nature of in-person
    education is being challenged.
    
    AoPS is breaking enrollment records across
    all their programs due to an onslaught of
    parents searching for at-home learning
    options for the first time.
    
    By delivering faster and more accurate
    student feedback, AoPS can help students
    improve their mathematical problem-solving
    skills and their delivery in explaining
    their answers.
    
    Among the students AoPS have trained are
    nearly all the members of the US
    International Math Olympiad team for the
    past 10 years and a number of the
    researchers / developers at OpenAI.
    
    By leveraging OpenAI’s technology, AoPS is
    empowering its human teachers as they
    evaluate students’ work and provide
    feedback on the accuracy, language and
    mastery of their solutions.
    
    AoPS continues to train OpenAI’s API on
    existing feedback from expert teachers,
    and are using it to quickly generate a
    first draft of feedback on a student’s
    work for the grader to refine and then
    send.
    
    The teacher’s final version is also shared
    back with the API to help improve it even
    further, and the teachers themselves are
    charged with evaluating the tool and
    deciding how widely it gets used.
    
    AoPS is currently testing the technology
    and seeing promising initial results.
    
    In the near term, AoPS believes that with
    OpenAI’s technology, students will be able
    to receive same-day feedback on their work
    while improving quality of feedback.

Natural Language Shell
    [#openai-api]
    [#productivity]
    [#nlp]
    [#semanticsearch]
    [#codegen]

    Here we show how the API can be used to
    translate natural language to unix
    commands, using a handful of
    representative examples.

Spreadsheets
    [#openai-api]
    [#data]
    [#nlp]

    In this example, we show how the API
    generates a table with suggested
    categories to make it easier to extract
    and organize information.

Code Completion
    [#openai-api]
    [#productivity]
    [#nlp]
    [#semanticsearch]
    [#codegen]

    With the API we can generate useful and
    context-aware code suggestions. After
    fine-tuning with code from thousands of
    Open Source GitHub repositories, the API
    completes code based on function names and
    comments.

Content Comprehension
    [openai-api]

    The API can be used to build tools to help
    individuals consume content more
    efficiently.

Koko
    [#openai-api]
    [#nlp]
    [#nlu]

    An online mental health intervention that
    has reached nearly two million people,
    mostly adolescents.
    
    The platform started as a clinical trial
    at MIT and is based on the concept of
    crowdsourced cognitive therapy.
    
    Unlike traditional peer support platforms,
    all interactions on the service are
    supported and augmented by AI.
    
    Koko is using OpenAI’s technology to
    enhance its AI capabilities and improve
    its ability to keep users safe.
    
    Using the API, Koko can automatically
    identify users in acute states of crisis
    and route them to specialized services
    (such as the National Suicide Prevention
    Lifeline).
    
    This builds on Koko’s existing work in
    this area, in collaboration with Harvard
    University, and allows them to scale the
    service more broadly.
    
    This partnership is especially important
    now, given the staggering rise in reported
    mental health symptoms following the onset
    of Covid-19.
    
    With OpenAI, Koko’s text-based classifiers
    improved substantially, without
    preprocessing.
    
    The F1 score of its crisis classifier went
    up from .76 to .86, and the accuracy went
    up to 96%.
    
    In the future, this capability could help
    peer supporters work faster and more
    efficiently, in addition to many other
    therapeutic use cases.

    [#nlu]

    Through its pattern recognition and
    generative capabilities, the API can
    transform dense text into simplified
    summaries.
    
    Here, we show the API summarizing an NDA
    into content that's accessible at a 2nd-
    grade reading level.

Polyglot
    [openai-api]

    While the API today works best in English,
    it also works quite well in other
    languages.
    
    The API can be used for tasks such as
    translation or chat with users in their
    preferred language.
