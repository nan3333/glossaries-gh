CFG Scale
Classifier Free Guidance scale
    A parameter to control how much the model
    should respect your prompt.

    1 = Mostly ignore your prompt. 
    3 = Be more creative.
    7 = A good balance between following the
        prompt and freedom.
    15 = Adhere more to prompt.
    30 = Strictly follow the prompt.

    Below are a few examples of increasing the
    CFG scale with the same random seed.
    
    In general, you should stay away from the
    two extremes - 1 and 30.

    Recommendation:
        Start with 7. Increase if you want it
        to follow your prompt more.

Sampling steps
    Quality improves as the sampling step
    increases.
    
    Typically 20 steps with Euler a sampler is
    enough to reach a high quality, sharp
    image.
    
    Although the image will still change
    subtly when stepping through to higher
    values, it will become different but not
    necessarily higher quality.

    Recommendation:
        20 steps. Adjust to higher if you
        suspect quality is low.

Sampling methods
    There’s a variety of sampling methods you
    can choose, depending on what GUI you are
    using:
    - Euler a
    - Euler
    - LMS
    - Heun
    - DPM2
    - DPM2 a
    - DPM fast
    - DPM adaptive
    - LMS Karras
    - DPM2 Karras
    - DPM2 a Karras
    - DDIM
    - PLMS
    
    They are simply different methods for
    solving diffusion equations.
    
    They are supposed to give the same result
    but could be slightly different due
    numerical bias.
    
    But since there’s no right answer here –
    the only criteria is the image looks good,
    accuracy of the method should not be your
    concern.
    
    There are discussions in online community
    claiming that certain sampling methods
    tend to yield particular styles.
    
    This is without theoretical merit.
    
    My suggestion is to leave it as the
    default.
    
    You would only want to change it if you
    want to speed things up.
    
    Recommendation:
        Leave it as default.
