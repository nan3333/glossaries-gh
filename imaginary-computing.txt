imaginary internet
imaginary web
    An imaginary world-wide-web is an
    analog of the World-Wide-Web imagined by a
    language model.

prompting
    The act of stoking a LM to perform a
    generation.

imagination
    The extrapolation of a language model's
    weights via prompting. The returned
    results of prompting.

imaginary reality
    The distinction between this and virtual
    reality is that virtual reality isn't
    really concerned so much with Neural
    Networks for a lazily generated potential
    reality that is constructed as one's own
    mind prompts another.
    
    Also virtual reality is engineered for
    people to explore where imaginary reality
    is generated at will by a user and does
    not follow rules.
    
    Imaginary reality takes place within a
    walled garden of a single mind /
    imagination forming around another.
    
    The interpretation of the output of one
    mind/neural net as have been sensed and
    interpreted by another mind / Neural
    Network, in real time.

pure imaginary reality
    This is one's personal introspective
    experience of their own imagination.

impure imaginary reality
    This is one's experience of another's
    imagination, whether that be another
    biological mind or a Neural Network.
