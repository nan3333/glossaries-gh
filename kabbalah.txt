Kabbalah
Jewish Kabbalah
    An esoteric method, discipline and school
    of thought in Jewish mysticism.
    
    A traditional Kabbalist in Judaism is
    called a Mekubbal (מְקוּבָּל‎ Məqūbbāl).
    
    The definition of Kabbalah varies
    according to the tradition and aims of
    those following it, from its origin in
    medieval Judaism to its later adaptations
    in Western esotericism (Christian Kabbalah
    and Hermetic Qabalah).
    
    Jewish Kabbalah is a set of esoteric
    teachings meant to explain the
    relationship between the unchanging,
    eternal God—the mysterious Ein Sof (אֵין
    סוֹף‎, "The Infinite")—and the mortal,
    finite universe (God's creation).
    
    It forms the foundation of mystical
    religious interpretations within Judaism.

Christian Kabbalah
    Arose during the Renaissance due to
    Christian scholars' interest in the
    mysticism of Jewish Kabbalah, which they
    interpreted according to Christian
    theology.
    
    It is often transliterated as Cabala (also
    Cabbala) to distinguish it from the Jewish
    form and from Hermetic Qabalah.

Hermetic Qabalah
    A Western esoteric tradition involving
    mysticism and the occult.
    
    It is the underlying philosophy and
    framework for magical societies such as
    the Golden Dawn, Thelemic orders,
    mystical-religious societies such as the
    Builders of the Adytum and the Fellowship
    of the Rosy Cross, and is a precursor to
    the Neopagan, Wiccan and New Age
    movements.
    
    The Hermetic Qabalah is the basis for
    Qliphothic Qabala as studied by left hand
    path orders, such as the Typhonian Order.
