The language English changes all the time.

We live in times where English is changing more rapidly than ever before.

For that reason, it's important to maintain my own glossary (words I know, for
example).

It pegs an approximate model of my personal language.

So long as I keep my glossary, people will be able to stay on the same page as
me; It's to show other people what they can talk to me about, and to allow
people to translate into a language I understand.
