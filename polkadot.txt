Relay Chain
    The heart of Polkadot, responsible for the
    network’s shared security, consensus and
    cross-chain interoperability.

Parachains
    Sovereign blockchains that can have their
    own tokens and optimize their
    functionality for specific use cases.

Parathreads
    Similar to parachains but with a pay-as-
    you-go model.
    
    More economical for blockchains that don’t
    need continuous connectivity to the
    network.

Bridges
    Allow parachains and parathreads to
    connect and communicate with external
    networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
