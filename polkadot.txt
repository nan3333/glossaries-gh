Relay Chain
    The heart of Polkadot, responsible for the
    network’s shared security, consensus and
    cross-chain interoperability.

Parachains
    Sovereign blockchains that can have their
    own tokens and optimize their
    functionality for specific use cases.

Parathreads
    Similar to parachains but with a pay-as-
    you-go model.
    
    More economical for blockchains that don’t
    need continuous connectivity to the
    network.

Bridges
    Allow parachains and parathreads to
    connect and communicate with external
    networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Nominators
    [Consensus Role]

    Secure the Relay Chain by selecting
    trustworty validators and staking dots.

Validators
    [Consensus Role]

    Secure the relay chain by staking dots,
    validating proofs from collators and
    participating in consensus with other
    validators.

Collators
    [Consensus Role]

    Maintain shards by collecting shard
    transactions from users and producing
    proofs for validator.

Fishermen
    [Consensus Role]

    Monitor the network and report bad
    behavior to validators.

    Collators and any parachain full node can
    perform the fisherman role.

Council Members
    [Governance Role]

    Elected to represent passive stakeholders
    in two primary governance roles: proposing
    referenda and vetoing dangerous or
    malicious referenda.

Technical Committee
    [Governance Role]

    Composed of teams actively building
    Polkadot.
    
    Can propose emergency referenda, together
    with the council, for fast-tracked voting
    and implementation.
