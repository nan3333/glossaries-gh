ego
    An infinitesimally small part of what Jung
    referred to as psyche.

    Psyche is the totality of all psychic
    processes, both conscious and unconscious.

    The ego is more or less just the center of
    consciousness.

    Both consciousness and the ego are
    latecomers in the evolution of psyche per
    se.

    Unconsciousness, however, was our original
    state of being, and thus, all of its
    underlying processes still have powerful
    effects on us.

ego death
psychic death
    A "complete loss of subjective self-
    identity".

    The term is used in various intertwined
    contexts, with related meanings.

    Jungian psychology uses the synonymous
    term psychic death, referring to a
    fundamental transformation of the psyche.

    https://exploremindfulness.wordpress.com/2015/12/11/what-is-ego-death/

    Considered a spiritual experience, one
    where you experience the cessation of
    sense and feeling of control living your
    life.

    Jungian psychology, ego death is often
    referred to as the death of consciousness,
    which may be accompanied by panic.
    
    Jungian psychology refers to ego death as
    psychic death, and goes on to explain it
    as a “shift back to the existential
    position of the natural self”.
    
    It is thought that after one experiences
    the death of consciousness, the
    consciousness is then resurrected.
    
    Carl Jung called this process the “the
    transcendent function”, which he believed
    led to a more “inclusive and synthetic
    consciousness”.
    
    It is believed that this process is a
    fundamental transformation of the psyche
    as it allows individuals to develop
    further understanding and peace of mind
    with the world and its inhabitants.

magical thinking
superstitious thinking
    The belief that unrelated events are
    causally connected despite the absence of
    any plausible causal link between them,
    particularly as a result of supernatural
    effects.

quiescent
    In a state or period of inactivity or
    dormancy.
    "strikes were headed by groups of workers
    who had previously been quiescent"

automatism
    Refers to involuntary actions and
    processes not under the control of the
    conscious mind—for example, dreaming,
    breathing, or a nervous tic.

prodrome
prodromal
    A medical term for early signs or symptoms
    of an illness or health problem that
    appear before the major signs or symptoms
    start.

    Psychosis, a group of symptoms found in
    disorders like schizophrenia, is one
    illness with a specific prodrome.

apperception
    [psychology]

    The mental process by which a person makes
    sense of an idea by assimilating it to the
    body of ideas he or she already possesses.

Free association
    The expression of the content of
    consciousness without censorship as an aid
    in gaining access to unconscious
    processes.

    The technique is used in psychoanalysis
    which was originally devised by Sigmund
    Freud out of the hypnotic method of his
    mentor and colleague, Josef Breuer.

conation
    [#psychology]

    The proactive (as opposed to habitual)
    part of motivation that connects
    knowledge, affect, drives, desires, and
    instincts to behavior.

    The behavioral basis of attitudes is
    sometimes referred to as the conative
    component.

counterfactual thinking
    A concept in psychology that involves the
    human tendency to create possible
    alternatives to life events that have
    already occurred; something that is
    contrary to what actually happened.

    Counterfactual thinking is, as it states:
    "counter to the facts".

episodic memory
    The memory of every day events (such as
    times, location geography, associated
    emotions, and other contextual
    information) that can be explicitly stated
    or conjured.

    It is the collection of past personal
    experiences that occurred at particular
    times and places; for example, the party
    on one's 7th birthday.

    Along with semantic memory, it comprises
    the category of explicit memory, one of
    the two major divisions of long-term
    memory (the other being implicit memory).

    The term "episodic memory" was coined by
    Endel Tulving in 1972, referring to the
    distinction between knowing and
    remembering: knowing is factual
    recollection (semantic) whereas
    remembering is a feeling that is located
    in the past (episodic).

    One of the main components of episodic
    memory is the process of recollection,
    which elicits the retrieval of contextual
    information pertaining to a specific event
    or experience that has occurred.

    Tulving seminally defined three key
    properties of episodic memory recollection
    as:
    - A subjective sense of time (or mental
      time travel).
    - Connection to the self.
    - Autonoetic consciousness, a special kind
      of consciousness that accompanies the
      act of remembering, which enables an
      individual to be aware of the self in a
      subjective time.

mindblind
mindblindness
    A few unfortunates suffer from a puzzling
    deficit, an inability to understand
    another's point of view.

    This condition is sometimes referred to as
    'mindblindness', and it is a major symptom
    of autism.

    To 'mindblind' humans, the world is a
    confusing place which they never 'get the
    hang of'.

volition
will
    [#psychology]

    The cognitive process by which an
    individual decides on and commits to a
    particular course of action.

    It is defined as purposive striving and is
    one of the primary human psychological
    functions.

    Others include affect, motivation, and
    cognition

strive
striving
    Make great efforts to achieve or obtain
    something.
    "national movements were striving for
    independence"

    Struggle or fight vigorously.
    "scholars must strive against bias"

gerund
    A gerund is any of various nonfinite verb
    forms in various languages; most often,
    but not exclusively, one that functions as
    a noun.

    In English, it has the properties of both
    verb and noun, such as being modifiable by
    an adverb and being able to take a direct
    object

retrieval-induced forgetting
    Occurs when recalling certain memories
    causes other related information to be
    forgotten.

    So repeatedly calling forth some memories
    might lead other memories to become less
    accessible.

    Traumatic or unwanted memories, for
    example, might be forgotten by repeated
    retrieval of more positive ones

repression
    The psychological attempt to direct one's
    own desires and impulses toward
    pleasurable instincts by excluding them
    from one's consciousness and holding or
    subduing them in the unconscious

confabulation
confabulate
    [#psychology]

    Fabricate imaginary experiences as
    compensation for loss of memory.

    "she has lapses in attention and
    concentration—she may be confabulating a
    little"

    A memory error defined as the production
    of fabricated, distorted, or
    misinterpreted memories about oneself or
    the world.

    People who confabulate present incorrect
    memories ranging from "subtle alterations
    to bizarre fabrications", and are
    generally very confident about their
    recollections, despite contradictory
    evidence.

    Confabulation is the creation of false
    memories in the absence of intentions of
    deception.

    Individuals who confabulate have no
    recognition that the information being
    relayed to others is fabricated.

cognitive bias
    A systematic pattern of deviation from
    norm or rationality in judgment.

    Individuals create their own "subjective
    reality" from their perception of the
    input.

    An individual's construction of reality,
    not the objective input, may dictate their
    behavior in the world.

    Shane: I think this term is contrived and
    based on a false premise that there is
    some kind of base reality. See simulation
    and simulacra.

tact

promnesia
déjà vu
    This is the term in psychology that means
    the feeling of having previously
    experienced an event or place actually
    being encountered for the first time.

    It is the same as the French phrase déjà
    vu which can be translated as "seen
    before".

    In parapsychology the same term is used
    similarly to precognition, which means
    knowing something and being able to
    describe it before you encounter it.

ineffable

    Our inability to connect physical
    phenomenon to these raw feelings, our
    inability to explain and share our own
    internal qualia.

cognitive load
    Refers to the used amount of working
    memory resources.

    Cognitive load theory differentiates
    cognitive load into three types:
    intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

Dunning-Kruger Effect
    The inability to understand one's own
    incompetence leads to inflated self-
    assessment.

    An illusory superiority that people
    believe (suffer from) in.

    This happens because of misjudging their
    cognitive abilities as greater, than it
    actually is.

    A cognitive bias in which people
    mistakenly assess their cognitive ability
    as greater than it is.

    It is related to the cognitive bias of
    illusory superiority and comes from the
    inability of people to recognize their
    lack of ability.

Theory of mind
    [#ai]

    knowledge, etc. - to oneself, and to
    others, and to understand that others have
    beliefs, desires, intentions, and
    perspectives that are different from one's
    own.

    Great apes possess the “theory of mind,”
    which means they can attribute mental
    states to themselves and others, and they
    can also understand that others may
    believe different information than they
    do.

Schizoid personality disorder
    An uncommon condition in which people
    avoid social activities and consistently

    elicited in the face of insult and/or
    injury.

dark empath
    Have a greater ability to make sense of
    others' motives and needs to help make
    decisions while retaining the ability to
    engage adaptive psychopathy when
    necessary, paralleling the relationship
    between Empaths and Typicals.

machiavellianism

    as being either external or internal.

    Models to explain this process are called
    attribution theory.

    caused by information-processing
    shortcuts which tend to simplify and save
    cognitive effort.

derealization
    A mental state where you feel detached
    from your surroundings.

    People and objects around you may seem
    unreal.
