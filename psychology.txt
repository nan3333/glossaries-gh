episodic memory
    The memory of every day events (such as
    times, location geography, associated
    emotions, and other contextual
    information) that can be explicitly stated
    or conjured.
    
    It is the collection of past personal
    experiences that occurred at particular
    times and places; for example, the party
    on one's 7th birthday.
    
    Along with semantic memory, it comprises
    the category of explicit memory, one of
    the two major divisions of long-term
    memory (the other being implicit memory).
    
    The term "episodic memory" was coined by
    Endel Tulving in 1972, referring to the
    distinction between knowing and
    remembering: knowing is factual
    recollection (semantic) whereas
    remembering is a feeling that is located
    in the past (episodic).
    
    One of the main components of episodic
    memory is the process of recollection,
    which elicits the retrieval of contextual
    information pertaining to a specific event
    or experience that has occurred.
    
    Tulving seminally defined three key
    properties of episodic memory recollection
    as:
    - A subjective sense of time (or mental
      time travel).
    - Connection to the self.
    - Autonoetic consciousness, a special kind
      of consciousness that accompanies the
      act of remembering, which enables an
      individual to be aware of the self in a
      subjective time.

mindblind
mindblindness
    A few unfortunates suffer from a puzzling
    deficit, an inability to understand
    another's point of view.
    
    This condition is sometimes referred to as
    'mindblindness', and it is a major symptom
    of autism.
    
    To 'mindblind' humans, the world is a
    confusing place which they never 'get the
    hang of'.

volition
will
    [#psychology]

    The cognitive process by which an
    individual decides on and commits to a
    particular course of action.
    
    It is defined as purposive striving and is
    one of the primary human psychological
    functions.
    
    Others include affect, motivation, and
    cognition

strive
striving
    Make great efforts to achieve or obtain
    something.
    "national movements were striving for
    independence"

    Struggle or fight vigorously.
    "scholars must strive against bias"

gerund
    A gerund is any of various nonfinite verb
    forms in various languages; most often,
    but not exclusively, one that functions as
    a noun.
    
    In English, it has the properties of both
    verb and noun, such as being modifiable by
    an adverb and being able to take a direct
    object

retrieval-induced forgetting
    Occurs when recalling certain memories
    causes other related information to be
    forgotten.
    
    So repeatedly calling forth some memories
    might lead other memories to become less
    accessible.
    
    Traumatic or unwanted memories, for
    example, might be forgotten by repeated
    retrieval of more positive ones

repression
    The psychological attempt to direct one's
    own desires and impulses toward
    pleasurable instincts by excluding them
    from one's consciousness and holding or
    subduing them in the unconscious

confabulation
    [psychology]

    A memory error defined as the production
    of fabricated, distorted, or
    misinterpreted memories about oneself or
    the world.
    
    People who confabulate present incorrect
    memories ranging from "subtle alterations
    to bizarre fabrications", and are
    generally very confident about their
    recollections, despite contradictory
    evidence.

cognitive bias
    A systematic pattern of deviation from
    norm or rationality in judgment.
    
    Individuals create their own "subjective
    reality" from their perception of the
    input.
    
    An individual's construction of reality,
    not the objective input, may dictate their
    behavior in the world.

    Shane: I think this term is contrived and
    based on a false premise that there is
    some kind of base reality. See simulation
    and simulacra.

promnesia
déjà vu
    This is the term in psychology that means
    the feeling of having previously
    experienced an event or place actually
    being encountered for the first time.
    
    It is the same as the French phrase déjà
    vu which can be translated as "seen
    before".
    
    In parapsychology the same term is used
    similarly to precognition, which means
    knowing something and being able to
    describe it before you encounter it.

ineffable
    Too great or extreme to be expressed or
    described in words.

explanatory gap
    Our inability to connect physical
    phenomenon to these raw feelings, our
    inability to explain and share our own
    internal qualia.

cognitive load
    Refers to the used amount of working
    memory resources.
    
    Cognitive load theory differentiates
    cognitive load into three types:
    intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

Dunning-Kruger Effect
    The inability to understand one's own
    incompetence leads to inflated self-
    assessment.

    An illusory superiority that people
    believe (suffer from) in.
    
    This happens because of misjudging their
    cognitive abilities as greater, than it
    actually is.

    A cognitive bias in which people
    mistakenly assess their cognitive ability
    as greater than it is.
    
    It is related to the cognitive bias of
    illusory superiority and comes from the
    inability of people to recognize their
    lack of ability.

Theory of mind

    Understands the needs of other intelligent
    entities.

    The ability to attribute mental states -

    others, and to understand that others have
    beliefs, desires, intentions, and
    perspectives that are different from one's
    own.

    Great apes possess the “theory of mind,”
    which means they can attribute mental
    states to themselves and others, and they
    can also understand that others may
    believe different information than they
    do.

    elicited in the face of insult and/or
    injury.

dark empath

    others' motives and needs to help make
    decisions while retaining the ability to
    engage adaptive psychopathy when
    necessary, paralleling the relationship
    between Empaths and Typicals.

machiavellianism
    [psychology]

    A personality trait which sees a person so
    focused on their own interests they will
    manipulate, deceive, and exploit others to

attribution
    [#psychology]

    Humans are motivated to assign causes to
    their actions and behaviors.
    
    Social psychology states that attribution
    is the process by which individuals
    explain the causes of behavior and events
    as being either external or internal.
    
    Models to explain this process are called
    attribution theory.
