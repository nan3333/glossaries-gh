henosis
    The classical Greek word for mystical
    "oneness", "union" or "unity".
    
    In Platonism, and especially Neoplatonism,
    the goal of henosis is union with what is
    fundamental in reality: the One, the
    Source, or Monad.

metanoia
    [#Theology]

    In Christian theology, metanoia is
    commonly understood as "a transformative
    change of heart; especially: a spiritual
    conversion." The term suggests
    repudiation, change of mind, repentance,
    and atonement; but "conversion" and
    "reformation" may best approximate its
    connotation.

Pleroma
    (in Gnosticism) the spiritual universe as
    the abode of God and of the totality of
    the divine powers and emanations.

Monad
the One
    In many Gnostic systems, God is known as
    the Monad, the One.
    
    God is the high source of the pleroma, the
    region of light.
    
    The various emanations of God are called
    æons.

aeon
æon
    (in Neoplatonism, Platonism, and
    Gnosticism) a power existing from
    eternity; an emanation or phase of the
    supreme deity.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_(Gnosticism)

    Various emanations of God are known by
    such names as One, Monad, Aion teleos
    (αἰών τέλεος "The Broadest Aeon"), Bythos
    (βυθός, "depth" or "profundity"), Proarkhe
    ("before the beginning", προαρχή), Arkhe
    ("the beginning", ἀρχή), and Aeons.
    
    In different systems these emanations are
    differently named, classified, and
    described, but emanation theory is common
    to all forms of Gnosticism.
    
    In Basilidian Gnosis they are called
    sonships (υἱότητες huiotetes; sing.:
    υἱότης huiotes); according to Marcus, they
    are numbers and sounds; in Valentinianism
    they form male/female pairs called
    syzygies (Greek συζυγίαι, from σύζυγοι
    syzygoi, lit.  "yokings together").
    
    This source of all being is an Aeon, in
    which an inner being dwells, known as
    Ennoea ("thought, intent", Greek ἔννοια),
    Charis ("grace", Greek χάρις), or Sige
    ("silence", Greek σιγή).
    
    The split perfect being conceives the
    second Aeon, Nous ("mind", Greek Νους),
    within itself.
    
    Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus
    produced, sometimes to the number of
    thirty.
    
    These Aeons belong to a purely ideal,
    noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible
    world; they are immaterial, they are
    hypostatic ideas.
    
    Together with the source from which they
    emanate, they form Pleroma ("fullness",
    Greek πλήρωμα).
    
    The lowest regions of Pleroma are closest
    to darkness—that is, the physical world.
