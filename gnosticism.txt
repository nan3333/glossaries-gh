Monad
the One
    In many Gnostic systems, God is known as
    the Monad, the One.
    
    God is the high source of the pleroma, the
    region of light constituting "the fullness
    of the Godhead."
    
    The various emanations of God are called
    æons.

    Through a process of emanation, various
    divine entities and realms emerge from the
    One.
    
    Arranged hierarchically, they become
    progressively degraded due to their
    remoteness from the Father.
    
    The various emanations of the One,
    totaling thirty in number (or 365,
    according to Basilides), are called Aeons.
    
    Among them exist Jesus (who resides close
    to the Father) and the lowest emanation,
    Sophia (wisdom), whose fall results in the
    creation of the material world.

    The Monad is a monarchy with nothing above
    it.
    
    It is he who exists as God and Father of
    everything, the invisible One who is above
    everything, who exists as incorruption,
    which is in the pure light into which no
    eye can look.
    
    “He is the invisible Spirit, of whom it is
    not right to think of him as a god, or
    something similar.
    
    For he is more than a god, since there is
    nothing above him, for no one lords it
    over him.
    
    For he does not exist in something
    inferior to him, since everything exists
    in him.
    
    For it is he who establishes himself.
    
    He is eternal, since he does not need
    anything.
    
    For he is total perfection.

Pleroma
    (in Gnosticism) the spiritual universe as
    the abode of God and of the totality of
    the divine powers and emanations.

Pistis Sophia
    The expression Pístis Sophía is obscure,
    and its English translations varied:
    - The Wisdom of Faith,
    - Faith Wisdom,
    - Wisdom in Faith, or
    - Faith in Wisdom

Gnosticism
    Gnosticism is the belief that human beings
    contain a piece of God (the highest good
    or a divine spark) within themselves,
    which has fallen from the immaterial world
    into the bodies of humans.
    
    All physical matter is subject to decay,
    rotting, and death.

    Gnosticism emphasizes individual knowledge
    and wisdom as the path to salvation and
    oneness with God.
    
    Its followers worship Sophia as both
    divine female creator and counterpart to
    Jesus Christ.
    
    According to Gnostic beliefs, Christ was
    conceived of as having two aspects: a male
    half, identified as the son of God, and a
    female half, called Sophia, who was
    venerated as the mother of the universe.

aeon
æon
    (in Neoplatonism, Platonism, and
    Gnosticism) a power existing from
    eternity; an emanation or phase of the
    supreme deity.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_(Gnosticism)

    Various emanations of God are known by
    such names as One, Monad, Aion teleos
    (αἰών τέλεος "The Broadest Aeon"), Bythos
    (βυθός, "depth" or "profundity"), Proarkhe
    ("before the beginning", προαρχή), Arkhe
    ("the beginning", ἀρχή), and Aeons.
    
    In different systems these emanations are
    differently named, classified, and
    described, but emanation theory is common
    to all forms of Gnosticism.
    
    In Basilidian Gnosis they are called
    sonships (υἱότητες huiotetes; sing.:
    υἱότης huiotes); according to Marcus, they
    are numbers and sounds; in Valentinianism
    they form male/female pairs called
    syzygies (Greek συζυγίαι, from σύζυγοι
    syzygoi, lit.  "yokings together").
    
    This source of all being is an Aeon, in
    which an inner being dwells, known as
    Ennoea ("thought, intent", Greek ἔννοια),
    Charis ("grace", Greek χάρις), or Sige
    ("silence", Greek σιγή).
    
    The split perfect being conceives the
    second Aeon, Nous ("mind", Greek Νους),
    within itself.
    
    Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus
    produced, sometimes to the number of
    thirty.
    
    These Aeons belong to a purely ideal,
    noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible
    world; they are immaterial, they are
    hypostatic ideas.
    
    Together with the source from which they
    emanate, they form Pleroma ("fullness",
    Greek πλήρωμα).
    
    The lowest regions of Pleroma are closest
    to darkness—that is, the physical world.

    Prominent early Christian gnostics like
    Valentinus taught that the Monad is the
    high source of the Pleroma, the region of
    light constituting "the fullness of the
    Godhead." Through a process of emanation,
    various divine entities and realms emerge
    from the One.
    
    Arranged hierarchically, they become
    progressively degraded due to their
    remoteness from the Father.
    
    The various emanations of the One,
    totaling thirty in number (or 365,
    according to Basilides), are called Aeons.
    
    Among them exist Jesus (who resides close
    to the Father) and the lowest emanation,
    Sophia (wisdom), whose fall results in the
    creation of the material world.

Marcosians
    The Marcosians were a Gnostic sect founded
    by Marcus, active in Lyon, France and
    southern Europe from the second to the 4th
    century.
    
    Women held special status in the Marcosian
    communities; they were regarded as
    prophetesses and participated in
    administering the Eucharistic rites.
    
    Irenaeus accuses Marcus of seducing his
    followers, and scornfully writes (Adversus
    Haereses I.
    
    13, 4) that the whole sect was an affair
    of "silly women." The Marcosian system was
    a variation of that of Valentinus.
    
    It retained the 30 Aeons, but called them
    "Greatnesses" and gave them numerical
    values.
    
    It kept the myth of the fall of Sophia but
    called it a "Divine Deficiency".
    
    Unique to it was the adaptation of the
    Pythagorean number theory (Isopsephy) to
    Gnosticism.

Tetrad
The Pythagorean Tetrad
    Marcus pushes into further details his
    designation of the Aeons as letters of the
    alphabet.

    There are twenty-four letters in the
    alphabet, and twenty-four is the sum of
    the letters of the names of the first
    tetrad:

    First tetrad:
    - The Unspeakable (ἄῤῥητος)
    - Silence (σειγή)
    - Father (πατήρ)
    - Truth (ἀλήθεια)

    Followed by those of the second tetrad:
    - Word (λόγος)
    - Life (ζωή)
    - Man (ἄνθρωπος)
    - Church (ἐκκλησία)

Sophia
Pistis
    Wanted to create something, alone without
    her consort; and her product was a
    celestial thing.

    Sophia is one of the central figures of
    Gnosticism, a Christian philosophical
    movement with uncertain origins that most
    likely originated in ancient Rome and
    Persia.
    
chrism
    A ritual anointing with sacred olive oil,
    was what allowed a believer to truly be
    termed a Christian and allowed those
    chosen to move past demons to an eventual
    resurrection.

henosis
    The classical Greek word for mystical
    "oneness", "union" or "unity".
    
    In Platonism, and especially Neoplatonism,
    the goal of henosis is union with what is
    fundamental in reality: the One, the
    Source, or Monad.

metanoia
    [#Theology]

    In Christian theology, metanoia is
    commonly understood as "a transformative
    change of heart; especially: a spiritual
    conversion." The term suggests
    repudiation, change of mind, repentance,
    and atonement; but "conversion" and
    "reformation" may best approximate its
    connotation.

Simonians
    The Simonians were a Gnostic sect of the
    2nd century which regarded Simon Magus as
    its founder and traced its doctrines,
    known as Simonianism, back to him.
    
    The sect flourished in Syria, in various
    districts of Asia Minor and at Rome.

precosmic
    Occurring or existing before the existence
    of the universe.
