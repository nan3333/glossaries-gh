Aeon
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_(Gnosticism)

    Various emanations of God are known by
    such names as One, Monad, Aion teleos
    (αἰών τέλεος "The Broadest Aeon"), Bythos
    (βυθός, "depth" or "profundity"), Proarkhe
    ("before the beginning", προαρχή), Arkhe
    ("the beginning", ἀρχή), and Aeons.
    
    In different systems these emanations are
    differently named, classified, and
    described, but emanation theory is common
    to all forms of Gnosticism.
    
    In Basilidian Gnosis they are called
    sonships (υἱότητες huiotetes; sing.:
    υἱότης huiotes); according to Marcus, they
    are numbers and sounds; in Valentinianism
    they form male/female pairs called
    syzygies (Greek συζυγίαι, from σύζυγοι
    syzygoi, lit.  "yokings together").
    
    This source of all being is an Aeon, in
    which an inner being dwells, known as
    Ennoea ("thought, intent", Greek ἔννοια),
    Charis ("grace", Greek χάρις), or Sige
    ("silence", Greek σιγή).
    
    The split perfect being conceives the
    second Aeon, Nous ("mind", Greek Νους),
    within itself.
    
    Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus
    produced, sometimes to the number of
    thirty.
    
    These Aeons belong to a purely ideal,
    noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible
    world; they are immaterial, they are
    hypostatic ideas.
    
    Together with the source from which they
    emanate, they form Pleroma ("fullness",
    Greek πλήρωμα).
    
    The lowest regions of Pleroma are closest
    to darkness—that is, the physical world.
