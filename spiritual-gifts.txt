word of knowledge
    Among Pentecostal and some Charismatic
    Christians, the word of knowledge is often
    defined as the ability of one person to
    know what God is currently doing or
    intends to do in the life of another
    person. It can also be defined as knowing
    the secrets of another person's heart.
