Jophiel
    The angel Jophiel (Heb.  יוֹפִיאֵל‎
    Yōp̄īʾēl, "God is my beauty [alternatively:
    Beauty of God"], "divine beauty"), also
    called Iophiel, Iofiel, Jofiel, Yofiel,
    Youfiel, Zophiel (צֹפִיאֵל‎ Ṣōfīʾēl,
    "spy of God", "watchman of God") and
    Zuriel (צוּרִיאֵל‎ Ṣūrīʾēl, "my rock is
    God"), is a non- canonical archangel of
    wisdom, understanding, and judgment.
    
    She is listed as one of the Seven
    Archangels in Pseudo-Dionysian teachings.
    
    Due to the association with beauty,
    Jophiel is one of very few angels to be
    sometimes portrayed as female.
    
    However, angels have no canonical gender,
    and are most commonly referred to by male
    pronouns.
