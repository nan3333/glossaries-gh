dialectical method
    A discourse between two or more people
    holding different points of view about a
    subject but wishing to establish the truth
    through reasoned argumentation.
    
    Dialectic resembles debate, but the
    concept excludes subjective elements such
    as emotional appeal and the modern
    pejorative sense of rhetoric.
    
    Dialectic may thus be contrasted with both
    the eristic, which refers to argument that
    aims to successfully dispute another's
    argument (rather than searching for
    truth), and the didactic method, wherein
    one side of the conversation teaches the
    other.
    
    Dialectic is alternatively known as minor
    logic, as opposed to major logic or
    critique.
