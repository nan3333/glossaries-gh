Category theory
    Formalizes mathematical structure and its
    concepts in terms of a labeled directed
    graph called a category, whose nodes are
    called objects, and whose labelled
    directed edges are called arrows.

coherence condition
    [#category theory]

    A collection of conditions requiring that
    various compositions of elementary
    morphisms are equal.
    
    Typically the elementary morphisms are
    part of the data of the category.

endofunctor
    [#category theory]

    A functor mapping a category to itself.

    A functor from one category back to the
    same category.
    
    It maps objects of the category to objects
    of the same category.
    
    The simplest example is the identity
    functor which maps every object inside a
    category back to itself; more interesting
    examples map objects to other objects in
    the same category.
