tawdry
    Showy but cheap and of poor quality.

verbal irony
    sarcasm
        "Great idea!", "I hear they do fine
        work."

    hyperbole
        "That's the best idea I have heard in
        years!"

    understatement
        "Sure, what the hell, it's only
        cancer..."

    rhetorical questions
        "What, does your spirit have cancer?"

    double entendre
        "I'll bet if you do that, you'll be
        communing with spirits in no time..."

    jocularity
        "Get them to fix your bad back while
        you're at it."

innuendo
    A form of wordplay.

    Saying one thing and meaning another.
    
    Innuendo only works when both parties
    understand the intended meaning.

    Example:
    - Woman 1: Do you know Arthur?
    - Woman 2: Oh yes, I know him very well.

    The intended meaning, of course, is that
    Woman 2 and ‘Arthur’ are intimately
    familiar.

double entendre
    A form of wordplay.
    
    It relies on an ambiguity in the phrasing
    or use of words in a statement.
    
    It is when a statement can be ‘read two
    ways’ (or three ways for a triple
    entendre).
    
    Typically the joke works because one
    reading is perfectly innocuous, whilst the
    second is rude, tawdry or sexual.

    Double Entendres have been a staple of
    comedy from music hall to vaudeville and a
    lot of 20th century English comedy,
    notably the Carry On films.

    Example:
    - New school head checks scaled back

    The first (intended) meaning is that
    checks for new school headteachers are to
    be reduced.

    The second (tawdry) is that the new school
    headteacher checks his scaled back,
    indicating he may be a reptile.

pun
    A form of wordplay.
    
    A pun exploits a word with two meanings,
    or two similar-sounding words for comedic
    effect.
    
    Puns may well be the oldest form of joke.

    Examples:
    “I have a dentist’s appointment at
    tooth-hurty (two-thirty)”.

    A fish and chip shop called ‘The
    Codfather’.

    Setup: “Why did the apple turn over?”
    Punchline: “Because it saw the swiss roll!
    This one’s a double pun because both apple
    turnover and swiss roll are types of
    dessert.

euphemism
    A form of wordplay.

    Substituting one word or expression for
    another whilst still preserving the
    meaning.
    
    This is done in order to render ‘polite’ a
    subject that is potentially offensive,
    frightening or upsetting.

    Examples:
    - ‘Passed away’ for died
    - ‘Making love’ for having sex
    - ‘Gardening leave’ for suspension from
      work.

Parataxis
    [literary technique]

    Favors short, simple sentences, without
    conjunctions or with the use of
    coordinating, but not with subordinating
    conjunctions.

    It contrasts with syntaxis and hypotaxis.

    Can most simply be described as and
    compared to the way children speak.
    
    They speak their ideas as they come to
    them, one after the other, without
    logically connecting the ideas together.
    
    Parataxis may use commas, semi-colons, and
    periods to force juxtaposition, but it can
    also replace these punctuation marks with
    "and" to seamlessly string the speech or
    written piece together and present the
    words as each being equally important.
    
    Works utilizing parataxis as a style may
    emit a staccato rhythm.
    
    This can result in phrases with words that
    don't seem to go together at all.
    
    An example of this is Julius Caesar's
    phrase "Veni, vidi, vici" or, "I came, I
    saw, I conquered".
    
    Parataxis can also be a pile of fast-
    moving ideas with a lack of or insistent
    rhythm.
    
    An example of this form of parataxis comes
    from the Bible.
    
    It says, "And God said, "Let there be
    light," and there was light."
