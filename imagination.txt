Maladaptive Daydreaming
MD
    Describes a condition where a person
    regularly experiences daydreams that are
    intense and highly distracting - so
    distracting, in fact, that the person may
    stop engaging with the task or people in
    front of them.

    Usually occurs as a coping mechanism in
    response to trauma, abuse or loneliness.

    Sufferers create a complex inner world
    which they escape to in times of distress
    by daydreaming for hours.

Fantasy prone personality
FPP
    A disposition or personality trait in
    which a person experiences a lifelong
    extensive and deep involvement in fantasy.

    This disposition is an attempt, at least
    in part, to better describe "overactive
    imagination" or "living in a dream world".

    An individual with this trait (termed a
    fantasizer) may have difficulty
    differentiating between fantasy and
    reality and may experience hallucinations,
    as well as self-suggested psychosomatic
    symptoms.

    Closely related psychological constructs
    include daydreaming, absorption and
    eidetic memory.
