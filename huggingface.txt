    An automatic way to train, evaluate and
    deploy SOTA NLP models for different
    tasks.

Inference API
Accelerated Inference API
    [[egr:Inference API]]

    Integrate into your apps over 10,000 pre-
    trained SOTA models, or your own private
    models, via simple HTTP requests, with 2x
    to 10x faster inference than built-in
    deployment, and scalability built-in.

mixed precision
    The use of both 16-bit and 32-bit
    floating-point types in a model during
    training to make it run faster and use
    less memory. 

Accelerate
    Provides an easy API to make your scripts
    run with mixed precision and on any kind
    of distributed setting (multi-GPUs, TPUs
    etc.) while still letting you write your
    own training loop.

    The same code can then runs seamlessly on
    your local machine for debugging or your
    training environment.

    Also provides a CLI tool that allows you
    to quickly configure and test your
    training environment then launch the
    scripts.
