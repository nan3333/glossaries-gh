isopsephy
isopsephism
    (/ˈaɪsəpˌsɛfi/; ἴσος isos meaning "equal"
    and ψῆφος psephos meaning "pebble")

    The practice of adding up the number
    values of the letters in a word to form a
    single number.
    
    The total number is then used as a
    metaphorical bridge to other words
    evaluating the equal number, which
    satisfies isos or "equal" in the term.
    
    The early Greeks used pebbles arranged in
    patterns to learn arithmetic and geometry,
    which corresponds to psephos or "pebble"
    and "counting" in the term.

    Isopsephy is related to gematria: the same
    practice using the Hebrew alphabet. 

Marcus
    The founder of the Marcosian Gnostic sect
    in the 2nd century AD.
    
    He was a disciple of Valentinus, with whom
    his system mainly agrees.
    
    His doctrines are almost exclusively known
    to us through a long polemic (i. 13–21) in
    Adversus Haereses, in which Irenaeus gives
    an account of his teaching and his school.
    
    Clement of Alexandria clearly knew of
    Marcus and actually used his number system
    (Stromata, VI, xvi), though without
    acknowledgement.
