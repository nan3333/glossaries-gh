computationalism
    A philosophy of mind theory stating that
    cognition is a form of computation.
    
    It is relevant to the simulation
    hypothesis in that it illustrates how a
    simulation could contain conscious
    subjects, as required by a "virtual
    people" simulation.
    
    For example, it is well known that
    physical systems can be simulated to some
    degree of accuracy.
    
    If computationalism is correct and if
    there is no problem in generating
    artificial consciousness or cognition, it
    would establish the theoretical
    possibility of a simulated reality.
    
    Nevertheless, the relationship between
    cognition and phenomenal qualia of
    consciousness is disputed.
    
    It is possible that consciousness requires
    a vital substrate that a computer cannot
    provide and that simulated people, while
    behaving appropriately, would be
    philosophical zombies.

philosophical zombie
p-zombie
    A thought experiment in philosophy of mind
    that imagines a hypothetical being that is
    physically identical to and
    indistinguishable from a normal person but
    does not have conscious experience,
    qualia, or sentience.
