PlanLogic
    Strictly speaking PrologCYC is a subset of
    LOGICMOO.

LOGICMOO

PPDL
Planning Domain Definition Language
    Used for factored representation.

    Describes four things:
    - initial state
    - actions that are available in a state
    - the result of applying an action, and
    - the goal test

factored representation
    Planning researchers have settled on a
    factored representation - one in which a
    state of the world is represented by a
    collection of variables.

Nomic
    A game created in 1982 by philosopher
    Peter Suber, the rules of which include
    mechanisms for changing those rules,
    usually beginning by way of democratic
    voting.
    
    The game is in some ways modeled on modern
    government systems, and demonstrates that
    in any system where rule changes are
    possible, a situation may arise in which
    the resulting laws are contradictory or
    insufficient to determine what is in fact
    legal.
    
    Its name derives from the Greek for "law",
    νόμος (nomos), because it models (and
    exposes conceptual questions about) legal
    systems and the problems of legal
    interpretation.

C_D
Compulsory_Dialog
    A Language Of Thought.

    Sequences that perform edits of I_Ts
    without regard to the rules of event
    calculus.
    
    These C_Ds are “language like” but not in
    terms of spoken language.

memories
    Pre-built memories (and later learned) are
    done as a “narrative” encoded in two ways:
    - I_T
    - C_D

reification

circumscription
    Restriction of something within limits.

    A form of non-monotonic reasoning.

    Circumscription is a non-monotonic logic
    created by John McCarthy to formalize the
    common sense assumption that things are as
    expected unless otherwise specified.

event calculus
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/event-calculus

    Characterized by a set of axioms and
    definitions.

    The event calculus uses reification: It
    treats time-varying properties and events
    as objects so that statements can be made
    about the truth values of properties at
    timepoints and the occurrences of events
    at timepoints.
    
    The event calculus uses circumscription,
    or the minimization of the extensions of
    predicates, to allow default reasoning.
    
    The event calculus uses the default
    assumptions that (1) the only events that
    occur are those known to occur and (2) the
    only effects of events are those that are
    known.
    
    When new information becomes available,
    the circumscriptions can be recomputed and
    reasoning again performed, which may lead
    to new conclusions.
    
    Circumscription is defined by a formula of
    second-order logic, but in most cases of
    interest circumscriptions compile into
    formulas of firstorder logic.
