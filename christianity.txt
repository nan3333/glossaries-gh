    Consists in witnessing to one's personal
    conversion and to one's faith in Jesus,
    before the believer's baptism.
    
    This rite is thus reserved for adolescents

rhema
    A process within Christian epistemology.
    
    In this understanding, the logos is
    universal for all humanity, while any
    intellectual changes for a specific
    individual believer are categorized as
    rhema.
    
    Under this system, "rhema" is a broad term
    that includes many types of spiritual
    interaction; "any method God uses to
    reveal His specific will to an individual,
    whether by divinely directed desire,
    illumination, revelation, vision, or
    dream.
    
    ...rhema will be our general term to refer
    to all of these means of God communicating
    His specific will to an individual." Hamon
    states "A rhema is an inspired Word
    birthed within your own spirit, a whisper
    from the Holy Spirit like the still, small
    voice that spoke to Elijah in the cave.
    
    It is a divinely inspired impression upon
    your soul, a flash of thought or a
    creative idea from God.
    
    It is conceived in your spirit, but
    birthed into your natural understanding by
    divine illumination.
    
    A true rhema carries with it a deep inner
    assurance and witness of the Spirit." 

    Our general term to refer to all of these
    means of God communicating His specific
    will to an individual." Hamon states "A
    rhema is an inspired Word birthed within
    your own spirit, a whisper from the Holy
    Spirit like the still, small voice that
    spoke to Elijah in the cave.

atonement
    The moral influence or moral example
    theory of atonement, developed or most
    notably propagated by Abelard (1079–1142),
    [note 1] is an alternative to Anselm's
    satisfaction theory of atonement.
    
    Abelard focused on changing man's
    perception of God as not offended, harsh,
    and judgmental, but as loving.
    
    According to Abelard, "Jesus died as the
    demonstration of God's love," a
    demonstration which can change the hearts
    and minds of the sinners, turning back to
    God.

Gnosticism
    The result of Christianity spreading in
    the gentile world, where it crashed into
    other cultures with their own:
    - religions
    - philosophies
    - ideologies

    It's a fairly early development within
    Christianity.

    Some would go so far as to say that
    Gnosticism is the original form of
    Christianity.

    Viewed as a Christian heresy and their
    writings were banned destroyed and often
    burned by so-called proto-orthodox
    Christians.

proto-orthodoxy
proto-orthodox Christianity
    Often erroneously thought to have been

    adopted at the First Council of Nicaea in
    325.
    
    In 381, it was amended at the First
    Council of Constantinople.
    
    The amended form is also referred to as

    Constantinopolitan Creed for
    disambiguation.

catechism

catechesis
    Basic Christian religious education of
    children and adults, often from a
    catechism book.

    education of members who had been baptized
    as infants.

doctrine

preterism
preterist
    Holds that Ancient Israel finds its
    continuation or fulfillment in the
    Christian church at the destruction of
    Jerusalem in AD 70.
    
    The term preterism comes from the Latin
    praeter, which is a prefix denoting that
    something is "past" or "beyond".
    
    Adherents of preterism are known as
    preterists. They believe that 'most of
    prophesy' has already happened.

Isaiah
Esaias
    Name means
    - "jehovah is helper", or
    - "salvation is of the lord".

    The name of the greatest of the Assyrian
    group of prophets is synonymous with
    Joshua or Jesus and symbolic of his
    message.
    
    Little is known of this gospel prophet,
    often severe in tone.
    
    He is described as the son of Amoz, not
    Amos the prophet (Isa. 1:1; 2:1; 6:1; 7:3;
    13:1).
    
    Some scholars suggest that Amoz was the
    uncle of Uzziah which, if true, would make
    Isaiah the king’s cousin.
    
    Evidently Isaiah was of good family and
    education.

    - 1 Enoch
    - 2 Esdras

presuppositionalism
presuppositional apologetics
    A school of Christian apologetics that
    believes the Christian faith is the only
    basis for rational thought.
    
    It presupposes that the Bible is divine
    revelation and attempts to expose flaws in
    other worldviews.

    One of the four main approaches to
    apologetics, along with classical,
    evidential, and experiential or narratival
    apologetics.
    
    Each of these approaches places a
    different emphasis on the roles of reason
    and special revelation (such as Scripture
    or miracles) in apologetics.

classical apologetics
traditional apologetics
    A method of apologetics that begins by
    first employing various theistic arguments
    to establish the existence of God.
    
    Classical apologists will often utilize
    various forms of the cosmological,
    teleological (Design), ontological, and
    moral arguments to prove God’s existence.
    
    Once God’s existence has been established,
    the classical apologist will then move on
    to present evidence from fulfilled
    prophecy, the historical reliability of
    Scripture, and the bodily resurrection of
    Jesus to distinguish Christianity from all
    other competing forms of theism.
    
    classical apologetics has as its
    distinctive feature a two-step approach to
    establishing a Christian worldview.
    
    Classical apologists are often hesitant to
    make an argument directly from miracles to
    the biblical God.
    
    Rather, they prefer to appeal to miracles
    after having already established a
    theistic context.
    
    Modern proponents of classical apologetics
    include R.C.
    
    Sproul, William Lane Craig, and Norman
    Geisler.

evidential apologetics
evidentialism
    An approach to Christian apologetics
    emphasizing the use of evidence to
    demonstrate that God exists.
    
    The evidence is supposed to be evidence
    both the believer and nonbeliever share,
    that is to say one need not presuppose
    God's existence.

experiential apologetics
    Experiential apologetics is a reference to
    an appeal "primarily, if not exclusively,
    to experience as evidence for Christian
    faith."

    Also, "they spurn rational arguments or
    factual evidence in favor of what they
    believe to be a self-verifying
    experience."

    This view stresses experience that other
    apologists have not made as explicit, and
    in the end, the concept that the Holy
    Spirit convinces the heart of truth
    becomes the central theme of the
    apologetic argument.

narratival apologetics


dispensational
    A particular hermeneutic or analytical
    system for interpreting the Bible based on
    a literal translation, and which stands in
    contrast to the earlier Calvinist system
    of covenant theology used in biblical
    interpretation.

    Dispensationalism was first developed by
    John Nelson Darby around 1830, and
    considers biblical history as divided by
    God into dispensations, defined periods or
    ages to which God has allotted distinct
    covenants or administrative principles.

    According to dispensationalism, each age
    of God's plan is thus administered in a
    certain way, and humanity is held
    responsible as a steward during that time.

    Dispensationalists' presuppositions start
    with the inductive reasoning that biblical
    history has a particular discontinuity in
    the way God reacts to humanity in the
    unfolding of their, sometimes supposed,
    free wills.

premillennialism
    [#Christian eschatology]

    The belief that Jesus will physically
    return to the Earth (the Second Coming)
    before the Millennium, a literal thousand-
    year golden age of peace.

ecclesiastical
    Relating to the Christian Church or its
    clergy.
    "the ecclesiastical hierarchy"

complementarianism
    A theological view in Christianity,
    Judaism, and Islam, that men and women
    have different but complementary roles and
    responsibilities in marriage, family life,
    and religious leadership.

    The word "complementary" and its cognates
    are currently used to denote this view.

    Some Christians interpret the Bible as
    prescribing complementarianism, and
    therefore adhere to gender-specific roles
    that preclude women from specific
    functions of ministry within the
    community.

    Though women may be precluded from certain
    roles and ministries, they are held to be
    equal in moral value and of equal status.

    The phrase used to describe this is
    'Ontologically equal, Functionally
    different'.

    Complementarians assign primary headship
    roles to men and support roles to women
    based on their interpretation of certain
    biblical passages.

    One of the precepts of complementarianism
    is that while women may assist in the
    decision-making process, the ultimate
    authority for the decision is the purview
    of the male in marriage, courtship, and in
    the polity of churches subscribing to this
    view.

    The main contrasting viewpoint is
    egalitarianism, which maintains that
    positions of authority and responsibility
    in marriage and religion should be equally
    available to females as well as males.

restitution
    The restoration of something lost or
    stolen to its proper owner.

dispensation
dispensationalism
    A particular hermeneutic or analytical
    system for interpreting the Bible based on
    a literal translation, and which stands in
    contrast to the earlier Calvinist system
    of covenant theology used in biblical
    interpretation.

    Dispensationalism was first developed by
    John Nelson Darby around 1830, and
    considers biblical history as divided by
    God into dispensations, defined periods or
    ages to which God has allotted distinct
    covenants or administrative principles.

    According to dispensationalism, each age
    of God's plan is thus administered in a
    certain way, and humanity is held
    responsible as a steward during that time.

    Dispensationalists' presuppositions start
    with the inductive reasoning that biblical
    history has a particular discontinuity in
    the way God reacts to humanity in the
    unfolding of their, sometimes supposed,
    free wills.

    Dispensations:
    - Patriarch
    - Law, temple, priesthood
    - Gospel (requires individual response)

    Requirements were different, but one
    invarying requirement:
    - Learn to hear God's voice

    exemplary forms of Christian homily.

Divine command theory
    The belief that things are right because
    God commands them to be.

    In other words, it means that things which
    are considered wrong or unethical are
    wrong because they are forbidden by God.

    It is an absolutist theory.

    A meta-ethical theory which proposes that
    an action's status as morally good is
    equivalent to whether it is commanded by
    God.

    The theory asserts that what is moral is
    determined by God's commands and that for
    a person to be moral he is to follow God's
    commands.

    evangelist, who was a leader of a revival
    movement within the Church of England
