complementarianism
    A theological view in Christianity,
    Judaism, and Islam, that men and women
    have different but complementary roles and
    responsibilities in marriage, family life,
    and religious leadership.
    
    The word "complementary" and its cognates
    are currently used to denote this view.
    
    Some Christians interpret the Bible as
    prescribing complementarianism, and
    therefore adhere to gender-specific roles
    that preclude women from specific
    functions of ministry within the
    community.
    
    Though women may be precluded from certain
    roles and ministries, they are held to be
    equal in moral value and of equal status.
    
    The phrase used to describe this is
    'Ontologically equal, Functionally
    different'.
    
    Complementarians assign primary headship
    roles to men and support roles to women
    based on their interpretation of certain
    biblical passages.
    
    One of the precepts of complementarianism
    is that while women may assist in the
    decision-making process, the ultimate
    authority for the decision is the purview
    of the male in marriage, courtship, and in
    the polity of churches subscribing to this
    view.
    
    The main contrasting viewpoint is
    egalitarianism, which maintains that
    positions of authority and responsibility
    in marriage and religion should be equally
    available to females as well as males.

restitution

    stolen to its proper owner.

dispensation
dispensationalism
    A particular hermeneutic or analytical
    system for interpreting the Bible based on
    a literal translation, and which stands in
    contrast to the earlier Calvinist system
    of covenant theology used in biblical
    interpretation.
    
    Dispensationalism was first developed by
    John Nelson Darby around 1830, and
    considers biblical history as divided by
    God into dispensations, defined periods or
    ages to which God has allotted distinct
    covenants or administrative principles.
    
    According to dispensationalism, each age
    of God's plan is thus administered in a
    certain way, and humanity is held
    responsible as a steward during that time.
    
    Dispensationalists' presuppositions start
    with the inductive reasoning that biblical
    history has a particular discontinuity in
    the way God reacts to humanity in the
    unfolding of their, sometimes supposed,
    free wills.

    Dispensations:
    - Patriarch
    - Law, temple, priesthood
    - Gospel (requires individual response)

    Requirements were different, but one
    invarying requirement:
    - Learn to hear God's voice

    an action's status as morally good is
    equivalent to whether it is commanded by

    a person to be moral he is to follow God's
    commands.
