holographic principle
    A tenet of string theories and a supposed
    property of quantum gravity that states
    that the description of a volume of space
    can be thought of as encoded on a lower-
    dimensional boundary to the regionâ€”such as
    a light-like boundary like a gravitational
    horizon.
