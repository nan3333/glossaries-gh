carburetor
carburettor
carb
carby
    A device that mixes air and fuel for
    internal combustion engines in the proper
    airâ€“fuel ratio for combustion.
    
    It is sometimes colloquially shortened to
    carb in the UK and North America or carby
    in Australia.

camshaft
cam
    NLG: "Camshaft" refers to the shaft that
    connects the crankshaft to the valves in a
    car engine. The camshaft is also known as
    the "cam".

crankshaft
    NLG: "Crankshaft" refers to the part of an
    engine that converts the reciprocating
    motion of the piston into rotational
    motion.
    
    The crankshaft is a rotating part itself,
    called a "rotating axis".
    
    A "crankshaft" can be visually identified
    by the presence of the crank disc, also
    called the crank journal, on which the
    piston rod travels.

intake manifold
    NLG: "Intake manifold" refers to the part
    of an engine that distributes the fuel-air
    mixture to the cylinders.
    
    It is usually cast from aluminum or cast
    iron and is sometimes called a plenum
    chamber.

Single Overhead Cam
    NLG: "Single Overhead Cam" refers to an
    internal combustion engine with one
    camshaft to open the valves (as opposed to
    two camshafts as in a "twin overhead cam"
    engine).

piston
    NLG: "Piston" refers to the part of the
    engine that moves up and down, driven by
    the engine's crankshaft, and which in turn
    drives the wheels of the car.

crank disc
    NLG: "Crank disc" refers to the disc that
    is installed on the crank shaft of a car
    engine. The crank disc is usually
    attached to the flywheel of the engine.

flywheel
    NLG: "Flywheel" refers to a heavy wheel
    that stores kinetic energy, which can be
    transferred to a crankshaft to provide a
    torque to the engine.

torque
    NLG: "Torque" refers to the turning force
    that causes rotation. It is usually
    measured in foot-pounds or Newton-meters
    (Nm).
