camshaft
    NLG: "Camshaft" refers to the shaft that
    connects the crankshaft to the valves in a
    car engine. The camshaft is also known as
    the "cam".

crankshaft
    NLG: "Crankshaft" refers to the part of an
    engine that converts the reciprocating
    motion of the piston into rotational
    motion.
    
    The crankshaft is a rotating part itself,
    called a "rotating axis".
    
    A "crankshaft" can be visually identified
    by the presence of the crank disc, also
    called the crank journal, on which the
    piston rod travels.

intake manifold
    NLG: "Intake manifold" refers to the part
    of an engine that distributes the fuel-air
    mixture to the cylinders.
    
    It is usually cast from aluminum or cast
    iron and is sometimes called a plenum
    chamber.

Single Overhead Cam
    NLG: "Single Overhead Cam" refers to an
    internal combustion engine with one
    camshaft to open the valves (as opposed to
    two camshafts as in a "twin overhead cam"
    engine).
