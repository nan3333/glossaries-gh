Temple Mount
    Usually considered to be the holiest site
    in Judaism.
    
    In Judaic tradition, it figures as the
    place where God's divine presence was
    manifested more than in any other place,
    and is the place Jews turn towards during
    prayer.

cistern
    A waterproof receptacle for holding
    liquids, usually water.
    
    Cisterns are often built to catch and
    store rainwater.
    
    Cisterns are distinguished from wells by
    their waterproof linings.
    
    Modern cisterns range in capacity from a
    few litres to thousands of cubic metres,
    effectively forming covered reservoirs.
